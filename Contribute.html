For the main Kubernetes blog, we (the Kubernetes project) like to publish articles with different perspectives and special focuses, that have a link to Kubernetes.</p><p>With only a few special case exceptions, we only publish content that hasn't been submitted or published anywhere else.</p><p>Read the <a href="/docs/contribute/blog/guidelines/#what-we-publish">blog guidelines</a> for more about that aspect.</p><h2 id="official-kubernetes-blogs">Official Kubernetes blogs</h2><h3 id="main-blog">Main blog</h3><p>The main <a href="/blog/">Kubernetes blog</a> is used by the project to communicate new features, community reports, and any
news that might be relevant to the Kubernetes community. This includes end users and developers.
Most of the blog's content is about things happening in the core project, but Kubernetes
as a project encourages you to submit about things happening elsewhere in the ecosystem too!</p><p>Anyone can write a blog post and submit it for publication. With only a few special case exceptions, we only publish content that hasn't been submitted or published anywhere else.</p><h3 id="contributor-blog">Contributor blog</h3><p>The <a href="https://k8s.dev/blog/">Kubernetes contributor blog</a> is aimed at an audience of people who
work <strong>on</strong> Kubernetes more than people who work <strong>with</strong> Kubernetes. The Kubernetes project
deliberately publishes some articles to both blogs.</p><p>Anyone can write a blog post and submit it for review.</p><h2 id="maintenance">Article updates and maintenance</h2><p>The Kubernetes project does not maintain older articles for its blogs. This means that any
published article more than one year old will normally <strong>not</strong> be eligible for issues or pull
requests that ask for changes. To avoid establishing precedent, even technically correct pull
requests are likely to be rejected.</p><p>However, there are exceptions like the following:</p><ul><li>(updates to) articles marked as <a href="#maintenance-evergreen">evergreen</a></li><li>removing or correcting articles giving advice that is now wrong and dangerous to follow</li><li>fixes to ensure that an existing article still renders correctly</li></ul><p>For any article that is over a year old and not marked as <em>evergreen</em>, the website automatically
displays a notice that the content may be stale.</p><h3 id="maintenance-evergreen">Evergreen articles</h3><p>You can mark an article as evergreen by setting <code>evergreen: true</code> in the front matter.</p><p>We only mark blog articles as maintained (<code>evergreen: true</code> in front matter) if the Kubernetes project
can commit to maintaining them indefinitely. Some blog articles absolutely merit this; for example, the release comms team always marks official release announcements as evergreen.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next</h2><ul><li><p>Discover the official blogs:</p><ul><li><a href="/blog/">Kubernetes blog</a></li><li><a href="https://k8s.dev/blog/">Kubernetes contributor blog</a></li></ul></li><li><p>Read about <a href="/docs/contribute/review/reviewing-prs/#blog">reviewing blog pull requests</a></p></li></ul><div class="section-index"><ul><li><a href="/docs/contribute/blog/article-submission/">Submitting articles to Kubernetes blogs</a></li><li><a href="/docs/contribute/blog/guidelines/">Blog guidelines</a></li><li><a href="/docs/contribute/blog/article-mirroring/">Blog article mirroring</a></li><li><a href="/docs/contribute/blog/release-comms/">Post-release communications</a></li><li><a href="/docs/contribute/blog/writing-buddy/">Helping as a blog writing buddy</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div class="td-content"><h1>Submitting articles to Kubernetes blogs</h1><p>There are two official Kubernetes blogs, and the CNCF has its own blog where you can cover Kubernetes too.
For the <a href="/docs/contribute/blog/">main Kubernetes blog</a>, we (the Kubernetes project) like to publish articles with different perspectives and special focuses, that have a link to Kubernetes.</p><p>With only a few special case exceptions, we only publish content that hasn't been submitted or published anywhere else.</p><h2 id="writing-for-the-kubernetes-blog-s">Writing for the Kubernetes blog(s)</h2><p>As an author, you have three different routes towards publication.</p><h3 id="route-1">Recommended route</h3><p>The approach the Kubernetes project recommends is: pitch your article by contacting the blog team. You can do that via Kubernetes Slack (<a href="https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CJDHVD54J">#sig-docs-blog</a>).
For articles that you want to publish to the contributor blog only, you can also pitch directly
to <a href="https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C03KT3SUJ20">SIG ContribEx comms</a>.</p><p>Unless there's a problem with your submission, the blog team / SIG ContribEx will pair you up with:</p><ul><li>a blog <em>editor</em></li><li>your <em>writing buddy</em> (another blog author)</li></ul><p>When the team pairs you up with another author, the idea is that you both support each other by
reviewing the other author's draft article. You don't need to be a subject matter expert; most of
the people who read the article also won't be experts. We, the Kubernetes blog team, call the other author a writing buddy.</p><p>The editor is there to help you along the journey from draft to publication. They will either be
directly able to approve your article for publication, or can arrange for the approval to happen.</p><p>Read <a href="#authoring">authoring a blog article</a> to learn more about the process.</p><h3 id="route-2">Starting with a pull request</h3><p>The second route to writing for our blogs is to start directly with a pull request in GitHub. The
blog team actually don't recommend this; GitHub is quite useful for collaborating on code,
but isn't an ideal fit for prose text.</p><p>It's absolutely fine to open a placeholder pull request with just an empty commit, and then
work elsewhere before returning to your placeholder PR.</p><p>Similar to the <a href="#route-1">recommended route</a>, we'll try to pair you up with a writing buddy
and a blog editor. They'll help you get the article ready for publication.</p><h3 id="route-3-post-release-comms">Post-release blog article process</h3><p>The third route is for blog articles about changes in Kubernetes relating to a release. Each
time there is a release, the Release Comms team takes over the blog publication schedule. People
adding features to a release, or who are planning other changes that the project needs to announce, can
liaise with Release Comms to get their article planned, drafted, edited, and eventually published.</p><h2 id="article-scheduling">Article scheduling</h2><p>For the Kubernetes blog, the blog team usually schedules blog articles to publish on weekdays
(Gregorian calendar, as used in the USA and other countries). When it's important to publish on
a specific date that falls on a weekend, the blog team try to accommodate that.</p><p>The section on <a href="#authoring">authoring a blog article</a> explains what to do:</p><ul><li>initially, don't specify a date for the article</li><li>however, do set the article as draft (put <code>draft: true</code> in the front matter)</li></ul><p>When the Prow bot merges the PR you write, it will be a draft and won't be set to publish. A
Kubernetes contributor (either you, your writing buddy or someone from the blog team) then opens a small
follow-up PR that marks it for publication. Merging that second PR releases the previously-draft
article so that it can automatically publish.</p><p>On the day the article is scheduled to publish, automation triggers a website build and your
article becomes visible.</p><h2 id="authoring">Authoring an article</h2><p>After you've pitched, we'll encourage you to use either HackMD (a web Markdown editor) or a
Google doc, to share an editable version of the article text. Your writing buddy can read your
draft text and then either directly make suggestions or provide other feedback. They should
also let you know if what you're drafting feedback isn't in line with the
<a href="/docs/contribute/blog/guidelines/">blog guidelines</a>.</p><p>At the same time, you'll normally be <strong>their</strong> writing buddy and can follow our
<a href="/docs/contribute/blog/writing-buddy/">guide</a> about supporting their work.</p><h3 id="initial-administrative-steps">Initial administrative steps</h3><p>You should <a href="/docs/contribute/new-content/#contributing-basics">sign the CLA</a>
if you have not yet done so. It is best to make sure you start this early on; if you are
writing as part of your job, you may need to check with the workplace legal team or with
your manager, to make sure that you are allowed to sign.</p><h3 id="initial-drafting">Initial drafting</h3><p>The blog team recommends that you either use HackMD (a web Markdown editor) or a
Google doc, to prepare and share an initial, live-editable version of the article text.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>If you choose to use Google Docs, you can set your document into Markdown mode.</div><p>Your writing buddy can provide comments and / or feedback for your draft text and
will (or should) check that it's in line with the guidelines. At the same time, you'll
be their writing buddy and can follow the <a href="/docs/contribute/blog/writing-buddy/">guide</a>
that explains how you'll be supporting their work.</p><p>Don't worry too much at this stage about getting the Markdown formatting exactly right, though.</p><p>If you have images, you can paste in a bitmap copy for early feedback. The blog team can help
you (later in the process), to get illustrations ready for final publication.</p><h3 id="markdown-for-publication">Markdown for publication</h3><p>Have a look at the Markdown format for existing blog posts in the
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/master/content/en/blog/_posts">website repository</a>
in GitHub.</p><p>If you're not already familiar, read <a href="/docs/contribute/new-content/#contributing-basics">contributing basics</a>.
This section of the page assumes that you don't have a local clone of your fork and that you
are working within the GitHub web UI.
You do need to make a remote fork of the website repository if you haven't already done so.</p><p>In the GitHub repository, click the <strong>Create new file</strong> button. Copy your existing content
from HackMD or Google Docs, then paste it into the editor.
There are more details later in the section about what goes into that file.
Name the file to match the proposed title of the blog post, but don&#8217;t put the date in the file name.
The blog reviewers will work with you to set the final file name and the date when the article will be published.</p><ol><li><p>When you save the file, GitHub will walk you through the pull request process.</p></li><li><p>Your writing buddy can review your submission and work with you on feedback and final details.
A blog editor approves your pull request to merge, as a draft that is not yet scheduled.</p></li></ol><h4 id="front-matter">Front matter</h4><p>The Markdown file you write should use YAML-format Hugo
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">front matter</a>.</p><p>Here's an example:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-yaml"><span><span><span>---</span><span>

article <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">front matter</a>)</li></ul><h4 id="article-content">Article content</h4><p>Make sure to use second-level Markdown headings (<code>##</code> not <code>#</code>) as the topmost heading level in
the article. The <code>title</code> you set in the front matter becomes the first-level heading for that
page.</p><p>You should follow the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/">style guide</a>,
but with the following exceptions:</p><ul><li>we are OK to have authors write an article in their own writing style, so long as most readers
would follow the point being made</li><li>it is OK to use &#8220;we&#8220; in a blog article that has multiple authors, or where the article introduction clearly indicates that the author is writing on behalf of a specific group.
As you'll notice from this section, although we <a href="/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/#avoid-using-we">avoid using &#8220;we&#8221;</a> in our documentation,
it's OK to make justifiable exceptions.</li><li>we avoid using Kubernetes shortcodes for callouts (such as <code>{{&lt; caution &gt;}}</code>). This is
because callouts are aimed at documentation readers, and blog articles aren't documentation.</li><li>statements about the future are OK, albeit we use them with care in official announcements on
behalf of Kubernetes</li><li>code samples used in blog articles don't need to use the <code>{{&lt; code_sample &gt;}}</code> shortcode, and often
it is better (easier to maintain) if they do not</li></ul><h4 id="illustrations">Diagrams and illustrations</h4><p>For illustrations, diagrams or charts, use the <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure">figure shortcode</a> can be used where feasible. You should set an <code>alt</code> attribute for accessibility.</p><p>For illustrations and technical diagrams, try to use vector graphics. The blog team recommend SVG over raster (bitmap / pixel)
diagram formats, and also recommend SVG rather than Mermaid (you can still capture the Mermaid source in a comment).
The preference for SVG over Mermaid is because when maintainers upgrade Mermaid or make changes to diagram rendering, they may not have an easy way to contact the original blog article author to check that the changes are OK.</p><p>The <a href="/docs/contribute/style/diagram-guide/">diagram guide</a> is aimed at Kubernetes documentation,
not blog articles. It is still good to align with it but:</p><ul><li>there is no need to caption diagrams as Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.</li></ul><p>The requirement for scalable (vector) imanges makes the process more difficult for
less-familiar folks to submit articles; Kubernetes SIG Docs continues to look for ways to
lower this bar.
If you have ideas on how to lower the barrier, please volunteer to help out.</p><p>For other images (such as photos), the blog team strongly encourages use of <code>alt</code> attributes.
It is OK to use an empty <code>alt</code> attribute if accessibility software should not mention the
image at all, but this is a rare situation.</p><h4 id="commit-messages">Commit messages</h4><p>At the point you mark your pull request ready for review, each commit message should be a
short summary of the work being done. The first commit message should make sense as an overall
description of the blog post.</p><p>Examples of a good commit message:</p><ul><li><em>Add blog post on the foo kubernetes feature</em></li><li><em>blog: foobar announcement</em></li></ul><p>Examples of bad commit messages:</p><ul><li><em>Placeholder commit for announcement about foo</em></li><li><em>Add blog post</em></li><li><em>asdf</em></li><li><em>initial commit</em></li><li><em>draft post</em></li></ul><h4 id="squashing">Squashing</h4><p>Once you think the article is ready to merge, you should
<a href="https://www.k8s.dev/docs/guide/pull-requests/#squashing">squash</a> the commits in your pull
request; if you're not sure how to, it's OK to ask the blog team for help.</p></div></div><div><div class="td-content"><h1>Blog guidelines</h1><p>These guidelines cover the main Kubernetes blog and the Kubernetes
contributor blog.</p><p>All blog content must also adhere to the overall policy in the
<a href="/docs/contribute/style/content-guide/">content guide</a>.</p><h1 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h1><p>Make sure you are familiar with the introduction sections of
<a href="/docs/contribute/blog/">contributing to Kubernetes blogs</a>, not just to learn about
the two official blogs and the differences between them, but also to get an overview
of the process.</p><h2 id="original-content">Original content</h2><p>The Kubernetes project accepts <strong>original content only</strong>, in English.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4><p>The Kubernetes project cannot accept content for the blog if it has already been submitted
or published outside of the Kubernetes project.</p><p>The official blogs are not available as a medium to repurpose existing content from any third
party as new content.</p></div><p>This restriction even carries across to promoting other Linux Foundation and CNCF projects.
Many CNCF projects have their own blog. These are often a better choice for posts about a specific
project, even if that other project is designed specifically to work with Kubernetes (or with Linux,
etc).</p><h2 id="relevant-content">Relevant content</h2><p>Articles must contain content that applies broadly to the Kubernetes community. For example, a
submission should focus on upstream Kubernetes as opposed to vendor-specific configurations.
For articles submitted to the main blog that are not
<a href="/docs/contribute/blog/article-mirroring/">mirror articles</a>, hyperlinks in the article should commonly
be to the official Kubernetes documentation. When making external references, links should be
diverse - for example, a submission shouldn't contain only links back to a single company's blog.</p><p>The official Kubernetes blogs are <strong>not</strong> the place for vendor pitches or for articles that promote
a specific solution from outside Kubernetes.</p><p>Sometimes this is a delicate balance. You can ask in Slack (<a href="https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CJDHVD54J">#sig-docs-blog</a>)
for guidance on whether a post is appropriate for the Kubernetes blog and / or contributor blog -
don't hesitate to reach out.</p><p>The <a href="/docs/contribute/style/content-guide/">content guide</a> applies unconditionally to blog articles
and the PRs that add them. Bear in mind that some restrictions in the guide state that they are only relevant to documentation; those marked restrictions don't apply to blog articles.</p><h2 id="localization">Localization</h2><p>The website is localized into many languages; English is the &#8220;upstream&#8221; for all the other
localizations. Even if you speak another language and would be happy to provide a localization,
that should be in a separate pull request (see <a href="/docs/contribute/new-content/#languages-per-pr">languages per PR</a>).</p><h2 id="copyright-and-reuse">Copyright and reuse</h2><p>You must write <a href="#original-content">original content</a> and you must have permission to license
that content to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (so that the Kubernetes project can
legally publish it).
This means that not only is direct plagiarism forbidden, you cannot write a blog article if
you don't have permission to meet the CNCF copyright license conditions (for example, if your
employer has a policy about intellectual property that restricts what you are allowed to do).</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/main/LICENSE">license</a> for the blog allows
commercial use of the content for commercial purposes, but not the other way around.</p><h2 id="special-interest-groups-and-working-groups">Special interest groups and working groups</h2><p>Topics related to participation in or results of Kubernetes SIG activities are always on
topic (see the work in the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/contributor-comms/blogging-resources/blog-guidelines.md#contributor-comms-blog-guidelines">Contributor Comms Team</a>
for support on these posts).</p><p>The project typically <a href="/docs/contribute/blog/article-mirroring/">mirrors</a> these articles to both blogs.</p><h2 id="national-restrictions-on-content">National restrictions on content</h2><p>The Kubernetes website has an Internet Content Provider (ICP) licence from the government of China. Although it's unlikely to be a problem, Kubernetes cannot publish articles that would be blocked by the Chinese government's official filtering of internet content.</p><h2 id="what-we-publish">Blog-specific content guidance</h2><p>As well as the general <a href="/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/">style guide</a>, blog articles should (not must) align to
the <a href="/docs/contribute/blog/article-submission/#article-content">blog-specific style recommendations</a>.</p><p>The remainder of this page is additional guidance; these are not strict rules that articles
must follow, but reviewers are likely to (and should) ask for edits to articles that are
obviously not aligned with the recommendations here.</p><h3 id="illustrations">Diagrams and illustrations</h3><p>For <a href="/docs/contribute/blog/article-submission/#illustrations">illustrations</a> - including diagrams or charts - use the <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure">figure shortcode</a>
where feasible. You should set an <code>alt</code> attribute for accessibility.</p><p>Use vector images for illustrations, technical diagrams and similar graphics; SVG format is recommended as a strong preference.</p><p>Articles that use raster images for illustrations are more difficult to maintain and in some
cases the blog team may ask authors to revise the article before it could be published.</p><h3 id="timelessness">Timelessness</h3><p>Blog posts should aim to be future proof</p><ul><li>Given the development velocity of the project, SIG Docs prefers <em>timeless</em> writing: content that
won't require updates to stay accurate for the reader.</li><li>It can be a better choice to add a tutorial or update official documentation than to write a
high level overview as a blog post.</li><li>Consider concentrating the long technical content as a call to action of the blog post, and
focus on the problem space or why readers should care.</li></ul><h3 id="content-examples">Content examples</h3><p>Here are some examples of content that is appropriate for the
<a href="/docs/contribute/blog/#main-blog">main Kubernetes blog</a>:</p><ul><li>Announcements about new Kubernetes capabilities</li><li>Explanations of how to achieve an outcome using Kubernetes; for example, tell us about your
low-toil improvement on the basic idea of a rolling deploy</li><li>Comparisons of several different software options that have a link to Kubernetes and cloud native. It's
OK to have a link to one of these options so long as you fully disclose your conflict of
interest / relationship.</li><li>Stories about problems or incidents, and how you resolved them</li><li>Articles discussing building a cloud native platform for specific use cases</li><li>Your opinion about the good or bad points about Kubernetes</li><li>Announcements and stories about non-core Kubernetes, such as the Gateway API</li><li><a href="#post-release-comms">Post-release announcements and updates</a></li><li>Messages about important Kubernetes security vulnerabilities</li><li>Kubernetes projects updates</li><li>Tutorials and walkthroughs</li><li>Thought leadership around Kubernetes and cloud native</li><li>The components of Kubernetes are purposely modular, so writing about existing integration
points like CNI and CSI are on topic. Provided you don't write a vendor pitch, you can also write
about what is on the other end of these integrations.</li></ul><p>Here are some examples of content that is appropriate for the Kubernetes
<a href="/docs/contribute/blog/#contributor-blog">contributor blog</a>:</p><ul><li>articles about how to test your change to Kubernetes code</li><li>content around non-code contribution</li><li>discussions about alpha features where the design is still under discussion</li><li>"Meet the team" articles about working groups, special interest groups, etc.</li><li>a guide about how to write secure code that will become part of Kubernetes itself</li><li>articles about maintainer summits and the outcome of those summits</li></ul><h3 id="what-we-do-not-publish">Examples of content that wouldn't be accepted</h3><p>However, the project will not publish:</p><ul><li>vendor pitches</li><li>an article you've published elsewhere, even if only to your own low-traffic blog</li><li>large chunks of example source code with only a minimal explanation</li><li>updates about an external project that works with our relies on Kubernetes (put those on

recommend turning off an important security control in production clusters, because it can
be inconvenient, the Kubernetes project is likely to reject the article).</li></ul></div></div><div><div class="td-content"><h1>Blog article mirroring</h1><p>There are two official Kubernetes blogs, and the CNCF has its own blog where you can cover Kubernetes too.
For the main Kubernetes blog, we (the Kubernetes project) like to publish articles with different perspectives and special focuses, that have a link to Kubernetes.</p><p>Some articles appear on both blogs: there is a primary version of the article, and
a <em>mirror article</em> on the other blog.</p><p>This page describes the criteria for mirroring, the motivation for mirroring, and
explains what you should do to ensure that an article publishes to both blogs.</p><h1 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h1><p>Make sure you are familiar with the introduction sections of
<a href="/docs/contribute/blog/">contributing to Kubernetes blogs</a>, not just to learn about
the two official blogs and the differences between them, but also to get an overview
of the process.</p><h2 id="why-we-mirror">Why we mirror</h2><p>Mirroring is nearly always from the contributor blog to the main blog. The project does this
for articles that are about the contributor community, or a part of it, but are also relevant
to the wider set of readers for Kubernetes' main blog.</p><p>As an author (or reviewer), consider the target audience and whether the blog post is appropriate for the <a href="/docs/contribute/blog/#main-blog">main blog</a>.
For example: if the target audience are Kubernetes contributors only, then the
<a href="/docs/contribute/blog/#contributor-blog">contributor blog</a>.
may be more appropriate;
if the blog post is about open source in general then it may be more suitable on another site outside the Kubernetes project.</p><p>This consideration about target audience applies to original and mirrored articles equally.</p><p>The Kubernetes project is willing to mirror any blog article that was published to <a href="https://kubernetes.dev/blog/">https://kubernetes.dev/blog/</a>
(the contributor blog), provided that all of the following criteria are met:</p><ul><li><p>the mirrored article has the same publication date as the original (it should have the same publication time too,
but you can also set a time stamp up to 12 hours later for special cases)</p></li><li><p>For PRs that add a mirrored article to the main blog <em>after</em> the original article has merged into the contributor blog, ensure that all of the following criteria are met:</p><ul><li>No articles were published to the main blog after the original article was published to the contributor blog.</li><li>There are no main blog articles scheduled for publication between the publication time of the original article and the publication time of your mirrored article.</li></ul><p>This is because the Kubernetes project doesn't want to add articles to people's feeds, such as RSS, except at the very end of their feed.</p></li><li><p>the original article doesn't contravene any strongly recommended review guidelines or community norms</p></li><li><p>the mirrored article will have <code>canonicalUrl</code> set correctly in its
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">front matter</a></p></li><li><p>the audience for the original article would find it relevant</p></li><li><p>the article content is not off-topic for the target blog where the mirror article would
appear</p></li></ul><p>Mirroring from the main blog to the contributor blog is rare, but could feasibly happen.</p><h2 id="how-to-mirror">How to mirror</h2><p>You make a PR against the other Git repository (usually,
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website">https://github.com/kubernetes/website</a>) that adds
the article. You do this <em>before</em> the articles merge.</p><p>As the article author, you should set the canonical URL for the mirrored article, to the URL of the original article
(you can use a preview to predict the URL and fill this in ahead of actual publication). Use the <code>canonicalUrl</code>
field in <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">front matter</a> for this.</p></div></div><div><div class="td-content"><h1>Post-release communications</h1><p>The Kubernetes <em>Release Comms</em> team (part of
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-release">SIG Release</a>)
looks after release announcements, which go onto the
<a href="/docs/contribute/blog/#main-blog">main project blog</a>.</p><p>After each release, the Release Comms team take over the main blog for a period
and publish a series of additional articles to explain or announce changes related to
that release. These additional articles are termed <em>post-release comms</em>.</p><h2 id="opt-in">Opting in to post-release comms</h2><p>During a release cycle, as a contributor, you can opt in to post-release comms about an
upcoming change to Kubernetes.</p><p>To opt in you open a draft, <em>placeholder</em> <a href="https://www.k8s.dev/docs/guide/pull-requests/">pull request</a> (PR)
against <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website">k/website</a>. Initially, this can be an
empty commit. Mention the KEP issue or other Kubernetes improvement issue in the description
of your placeholder PR.</p><p>When you open the <strong>draft</strong> pull request, you open it against <em>main</em> as the base branch
and not against the <code>dev-1.35</code> branch. This is different from
the <a href="/docs/contribute/new-content/new-features/#open-a-placeholder-pr">process</a> for upcoming release changes and new features.</p><p>You should also leave a comment on the related <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements">kubernetes/enhancements</a>
issue with a link to the PR to notify the Release Comms team managing this release. Your comment
helps the team see that the change needs announcing and that your SIG has opted in.</p><p>As well as the above, you should ideally contact the Release Comms team via Slack
(channel <a href="https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CNT9Y603D"><code>#release-comms</code></a>) to let them
know that you have done this and would like to opt in.</p><h2 id="preparation">Preparing the article content</h2><p>You should follow the usual <a href="/docs/contribute/blog/article-submission/">article submission</a>
process to turn your placeholder PR into something ready for review. However, for
post-release comms, you may not have a <em>writing buddy</em>; instead, the Release Comms team
may assign a member of the team to help guide what you're doing.</p><p>You should <a href="https://www.k8s.dev/docs/guide/pull-requests/#squashing">squash</a> the commits
in your pull request; if you're not sure how to, it's absolutely OK to ask Release Comms or
the blog team for help.</p><p>Provided that your article is flagged as a draft (<code>draft: true</code>) in the
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">front matter</a>, the PR can merge at any
time during the release cycle.</p><h2 id="publication">Publication</h2><p>Ahead of the actual release, the Release Comms team check what content is ready (if it's
not ready by the deadline, and you didn't get an exception, then the announcement won't
be included). They build a schedule for the articles that will go out and open new
pull requests to turn those articles from draft to published.</p><div class="alert alert-caution"><h4 class="alert-heading">Caution:</h4>All these pull requests to actually publish post-release articles <strong>must</strong> be held
(Prow command <code>/hold</code>) until the release has actually happened.</div><p>The blog team approvers still provide final sign off on promoting the content from draft
to accepted for publication. Ahead of release day, the PR (or PRs) for publishing these
announcements should have LGTM (&#8220;looks good to me&#8221;) and approved labels, along with the
<strong>do-not-merge/hold</strong> label to ensure the PR doesn't merge too early.</p><p>Release Comms / the Release Team can then <em>unhold</em> that PR (or set of PRs) as soon as the
website Git repository is unfrozen after the actual release.</p><p>On the day each article is scheduled to publish, automation triggers a website build and that
article becomes visible.</p></div></div><div><div class="td-content"><h1>Helping as a blog writing buddy</h1><p>There are two official Kubernetes blogs, and the CNCF has its own blog where you can cover Kubernetes too.
Read <a href="/docs/contribute/blog/">contributing to Kubernetes blogs</a> to learn about these two blogs.</p><p>When people contribute to either blog as an author, the Kubernetes project pairs up authors
as <em>writing buddies</em>. This page explains how to fulfil the buddy role.</p><p>You should make sure that you have at least read an outline of <a href="/docs/contribute/blog/article-submission/">article submission</a>
before you read on within this page.</p><h2 id="buddy-responsibilities">Buddy responsibilities</h2><p>As a writing buddy, you:</p><ul><li>help the blog team get articles ready to merge and to publish</li><li>support your buddy to produce content that is good to merge</li><li>provide a review on the article that your buddy has written</li></ul><p>When the team pairs you up with another author, the idea is that you both support each other by
reviewing the other author's draft article.
Most people reading articles on the Kubernetes blog are not experts; the content should
try to make sense for that audience, or at least to support non-expert readers appropriately.</p><p>The blog team are also there to help you both along the journey from draft to publication.
They will either be directly able to approve your article for publication, or can arrange for
the approval to happen.</p><h2 id="supporting-the-blog-team">Supporting the blog team</h2><p>Your main responsibility here is to communicate about your capacity, availability and progress
in a reasonable timeline. If many weeks go by and your buddy hasn't heard from you, it makes
the overall work take more time.</p><h2 id="supporting-your-buddy">Supporting your buddy</h2><p>There are two parts to the process</p><ul class="nav nav-tabs" id="buddy-support"><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link active" href="#buddy-support-0">Collaborative editing</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="#buddy-support-1">Markdown / Git editing</a></li></ul><div class="tab-content" id="buddy-support"><div id="buddy-support-0" class="tab-pane show active"><p><p><strong>(This is the recommended option)</strong></p><p>The blog team recommend that the main author for the article sets up collaborative editing
using either a Google Doc or HackMD (their choice). The main author then shares that document
with the following people:</p><ul><li>Any co-authors</li><li>You (their writing buddy)</li><li>Ideally, with a nominated
person from the blog team.</li></ul><p>As a writing buddy, you then read the draft text and either directly make suggestions or provide
feedback in a different way. The author of the blog is very commonly also <strong>your</strong> writing buddy in turn, so they will provide the
same kind of feedback on the draft for your blog article.</p><p>Your role here is to recommend the smallest set of changes that will get the article look good
for publication. If there's a diagram that really doesn't make sense, or the writing is really
unclear: provide feedback. If you have a slight different of opinion about wording or punctuation,
skip it. Let the article author(s) write in their own style, provided that they align to
the <a href="/docs/contribute/blog/guidelines/">blog guidelines</a>.</p><p>After this is ready, the lead author will open a pull request and use Markdown to submit the
article. You then provide a <a href="#pull-request-review">review</a>.</p></p></div><div id="buddy-support-1" class="tab-pane"><p><p>Some authors prefer to start with
<a href="#buddy-support-0">collaborative editing</a>; others like to go straight into
GitHub.</p><p>Whichever route they take, your role is to provide feedback that lets the blog team provide
a simple signoff and confirm that the article can merge as a draft. See
<a href="/docs/contribute/blog/article-submission/">submitting articles to Kubernetes blogs</a> for what the authors
need to do.</p><p>Use GitHub suggestions to point out any required changes.</p><p>Once the Markdown and other content (such as images) look right, you provide a
formal <a href="#pull-request-review">review</a>.</p></p></div></div><h2 id="pull-request-review">Pull request review</h2><p>Follow the <a href="/docs/contribute/review/reviewing-prs/#blog">blog</a> section of <em>Reviewing pull requests</em>.</p><p>When you think that the open blog pull request is good enough to merge, add the <code>/lgtm</code> comment to the pull request.</p><p>This indicates to the repository automation tooling (Prow) that the content "looks good to me". Prow moves things forward. The <code>/lgtm</code> command lets you add your opinion to the record whether or not you are formally a member of the Kubernetes project.</p><p>Either you or the article author(s) should let the blog team know that there is an article
ready for signoff. It should already be marked as <code>draft: true</code> in the front matter, as
explained in the submission guidance.</p><h2 id="subsequent-steps">Subsequent steps</h2><p>For you as a writing buddy, <strong>there is no step four</strong>. Once the pull request is good to merge,
the blog team (or, for the contributor site, the contributor comms team) take things from there.
It's possible that you'll need to return to an earlier step based on feedback, but you can usually expect that your work as a buddy is done.</p></div></div><div><div class="td-content"><h1>Suggesting content improvements</h1><p>If you notice an issue with Kubernetes documentation or have an idea for new content, then open an issue. All you need is a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a> and a web browser.</p><p>In most cases, new work on Kubernetes documentation begins with an issue in GitHub. Kubernetes contributors
then review, categorize and tag issues as needed. Next, you or another member
of the Kubernetes community open a pull request with changes to resolve the issue.</p><h2 id="opening-an-issue">Opening an issue</h2><p>If you want to suggest improvements to existing content or notice an error, then open an issue.</p><ol><li>Click the <strong>Create an issue</strong> link on the right sidebar. This redirects you
to a GitHub issue page pre-populated with some headers.</li><li>Describe the issue or suggestion for improvement. Provide as many details as you can.</li><li>Click <strong>Submit new issue</strong>.</li></ol><p>After submitting, check in on your issue occasionally or turn on GitHub notifications.
Reviewers and other community members might ask questions before
they can take action on your issue.</p><h2 id="suggesting-new-content">Suggesting new content</h2><p>If you have an idea for new content, but you aren't sure where it should go, you can
still file an issue. Either:</p><ul><li>Choose an existing page in the section you think the content belongs in and click <strong>Create an issue</strong>.</li><li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/new/">GitHub</a> and file the issue directly.</li></ul><h2 id="how-to-file-great-issues">How to file great issues</h2><p>Keep the following in mind when filing an issue:</p><ul><li>Provide a clear issue description. Describe what specifically is missing, out of date,
wrong, or needs improvement.</li><li>Explain the specific impact the issue has on users.</li><li>Limit the scope of a given issue to a reasonable unit of work. For problems
with a large scope, break them down into smaller issues. For example, "Fix the security docs"
is too broad, but "Add details to the 'Restricting network access' topic" is specific enough
to be actionable.</li><li>Search the existing issues to see if there's anything related or similar to the
new issue.</li><li>If the new issue relates to another issue or pull request, refer to it
either by its full URL or by the issue or pull request number prefixed
with a <code>#</code> character. For example, <code>Introduced by #987654</code>.</li><li>Follow the <a href="/community/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>. Respect your
fellow contributors. For example, "The docs are terrible" is not
helpful or polite feedback.</li></ul></div></div><div><div class="td-content"><h1>Contributing new content</h1><p>This section contains information you should know before contributing new

New releases also bring updates to existing features and documentation
(such as upgrading a feature from alpha to beta).</p><p>Generally, the SIG responsible for a feature submits draft documentation of the
feature as a pull request to the appropriate development branch of the
<code>kubernetes/website</code> repository, and someone on the SIG Docs team provides
editorial feedback or edits the draft directly. This section covers the branching
conventions and process used during a release by both groups.</p><p>To learn about announcing features on the blog, read
<a href="/docs/contribute/blog/release-comms/">post-release communications</a>.</p><h2 id="for-documentation-contributors">For documentation contributors</h2><p>In general, documentation contributors don't write content from scratch for a release.
Instead, they work with the SIG creating a new feature to refine the draft documentation
and make it release ready.</p><p>After you've chosen a feature to document or assist, ask about it in the <code>#sig-docs</code>
Slack channel, in a weekly SIG Docs meeting, or directly on the PR filed by the
feature SIG. If you're given the go-ahead, you can edit into the PR using one of
the techniques described in

the <a href="/community/">community</a> page for upcoming meetings)
and monitor the release-specific documentation
in the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/">kubernetes/sig-release</a>
repository. Each release has a sub-directory in the
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases">/sig-release/tree/master/releases/</a>
directory. The sub-directory contains a release schedule, a draft of the release
notes, and a document listing each person on the release team.</p><p>The release schedule contains links to all other documents, meetings,
meeting minutes, and milestones relating to the release. It also contains
information about the goals and timeline of the release, and any special
processes in place for this release. Near the bottom of the document, several
release-related terms are defined.</p><p>This document also contains a link to the <strong>Feature tracking sheet</strong>, which is
the official way to find out about all new features scheduled to go into the
release.</p><p>The release team document lists who is responsible for each release role. If
it's not clear who to talk to about a specific feature or question you have,
either attend the release meeting to ask your question, or contact the release
lead so that they can redirect you.</p><p>The release notes draft is a good place to find out about
specific features, changes, deprecations, and more about the release. The
content is not finalized until late in the release cycle, so use caution.</p><h3 id="feature-tracking-sheet">Feature tracking sheet</h3><p>The feature tracking sheet <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases">for a given Kubernetes release</a>
lists each feature that is planned for a release.
Each line item includes the name of the feature, a link to the feature's main
GitHub issue, its stability level (Alpha, Beta, or Stable), the SIG and
individual responsible for implementing it, whether it
needs docs, a draft release note for the feature, and whether it has been
merged. Keep the following in mind:</p><ul><li>Beta and Stable features are generally a higher documentation priority than
Alpha features.</li><li>It's hard to test (and therefore to document) a feature that hasn't been merged,
or is at least considered feature-complete in its PR.</li><li>Determining whether a feature needs documentation is a manual process. Even if
a feature is not marked as needing docs, you may need to document the feature.</li></ul><h2 id="for-developers-or-other-sig-members">For developers or other SIG members</h2><p>This section is information for members of other Kubernetes SIGs documenting new features
for a release.</p><p>If you are a member of a SIG developing a new feature for Kubernetes, you need
to work with SIG Docs to be sure your feature is documented in time for the
release. Check the
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases">feature tracking spreadsheet</a>
or check in the <code>#sig-release</code> Kubernetes Slack channel to verify scheduling details and
deadlines.</p><h3 id="open-a-placeholder-pr">Open a placeholder PR</h3><ol><li>Open a <strong>draft</strong> pull request against the
<code>dev-1.35</code> branch in the <code>kubernetes/website</code> repository, with a small
commit that you will amend later. To create a draft pull request, use the
<strong>Create Pull Request</strong> drop-down and select <strong>Create Draft Pull Request</strong>,
then click <strong>Draft Pull Request</strong>.</li><li>Edit the pull request description to include links to <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">kubernetes/kubernetes</a>
PR(s) and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements">kubernetes/enhancements</a> issue(s).</li><li>Leave a comment on the related <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements">kubernetes/enhancements</a>
issue with a link to the PR to notify the docs person managing this release that
the feature docs are coming and should be tracked for the release.</li></ol><p>If your feature does not need any documentation changes, make sure the sig-release team knows this,
by mentioning it in the <code>#sig-release</code> Slack channel. If the feature does need
documentation but the PR is not created, the feature may be removed from the milestone.</p><h3 id="pr-ready-for-review">PR ready for review</h3><p>When ready, populate your placeholder PR with feature documentation and change
the state of the PR from draft to <strong>ready for review</strong>. To mark a pull request
as ready for review, navigate to the merge box and click <strong>Ready for review</strong>.</p><p>Do your best to describe your feature and how to use it. If you need help
structuring your documentation, ask in the <code>#sig-docs</code> Slack channel.</p><p>When you complete your content, the documentation person assigned to your feature reviews it.
To ensure technical accuracy, the content may also require a technical review from corresponding SIG(s).
Use their suggestions to get the content to a release ready state.</p><p>If your feature needs documentation and the first draft
content is not received, the feature may be removed from the milestone.</p><h4 id="ready-for-review-feature-gates">Feature gates</h4><p>If your feature is an Alpha or Beta feature and is behind a feature gate,
you need a feature gate file for it inside
<code>content/en/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/</code>.
The name of the file should be the name of the feature gate with <code>.md</code> as the suffix.
You can look at other files already in the same directory for a hint about what yours
should look like. Usually a single paragraph is enough; for longer explanations,
add documentation elsewhere and link to that.</p><p>Also, to ensure your feature gate appears in the
<a href="/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-gates-for-alpha-or-beta-features">Alpha/Beta Feature gates</a>
table, include the following details in the
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">front matter</a>
of your Markdown description file:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-yaml"><span><span><span>stages</span>:<span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>With net new feature gates, a separate description of the feature gate is also required;
create a new Markdown file inside <code>content/en/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/</code>
(use other files as a template).</p><p>When you change a feature gate from disabled-by-default to enabled-by-default,
you may also need to change other documentation (not just the list of
feature gates). Watch out for language such as &#8221;The <code>exampleSetting</code> field
is a beta field and disabled by default. You can enable it by enabling the
<code>ProcessExampleThings</code> feature gate.&#8221;</p><p>If your feature is GA'ed or deprecated, include an additional <code>stage</code> entry within
the <code>stages</code> block in the description file.
Ensure that the Alpha and Beta stages remain intact. This step transitions the
feature gate from the
<a href="/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-gates-for-alpha-or-beta-features">Feature gates for Alpha/Beta</a> table
to <a href="/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-gates-for-graduated-or-deprecated-features">Feature gates for graduated or deprecated features</a>

Unless the author is clearly aiming to update the entire page, they have no obligation to

the page that are being updated. That changed content should be reviewed for technical
and editorial correctness.

is attempting to address, then it should be treated as a separate issue (check
that there isn't an existing issue about this first).</li><li>Watch out for pull requests that <em>move</em> content. If an author renames a page

anything that is attributed to someone or part of a dialog that has happened - even if you think
the original speaker's grammar was not correct. For those cases, also, try to respect the article
author's suggested punctuation unless it is obviously wrong.</p><p>As a project, we only mark blog articles as maintained (<code>evergreen: true</code> in front matter) if the Kubernetes project

Some blog articles absolutely merit this, and we always mark our release announcements evergreen. Check with other contributors if you are not sure how to review on this point.</p><p>The <a href="/docs/contribute/style/content-guide/">content guide</a> applies unconditionally to blog articles and the PRs that add them.

(it's still OK to accept the change if it is genuinely an improvement).</p><p>Encourage authors who are making whitespace fixes to do
so in the first commit of their PR, and then add other changes on top of that. This
makes both merges and reviews easier. Watch out especially for a trivial change that
happens in a single commit along with a large amount of whitespace cleanup
(and if you see that, encourage the author to fix it).</p><p>As a reviewer, if you identify small issues with a PR that aren't essential to the meaning,
such as typos or incorrect whitespace, prefix your comments with <code>nit:</code>.
This lets the author know that this part of your feedback is non-critical.</p><p>If you are considering a pull request for approval and all the remaining feedback is
marked as a nit, you can merge the PR anyway. In that case, it's often useful to open
an issue about the remaining nits. Consider whether you're able to meet the requirements

to handle them.</p><h3 id="duplicate-issues">Duplicate issues</h3><p>If a single problem has one or more issues open for it, combine them into a single issue.
You should decide which issue to keep open (or
open a new issue), then move over all relevant information and link related issues.
Finally, label all other issues that describe the same problem with
<code>triage/duplicate</code> and close them. Only having a single issue to work on reduces confusion
and avoids duplicate work on the same problem.</p><h3 id="dead-link-issues">Dead link issues</h3><p>If the dead link issue is in the API or <code>kubectl</code> documentation, assign them
<code>/priority critical-urgent</code> until the problem is fully understood. Assign all
other dead link issues <code>/priority important-longterm</code>, as they must be manually fixed.</p><h3 id="blog-issues">Blog issues</h3><p>We expect <a href="/blog/">Kubernetes Blog</a> entries to become
outdated over time. Therefore, we only maintain blog entries less than a year old.
If an issue is related to a blog entry that is more than one year old,
you should typically close the issue without fixing.</p><p>You can send a link to <a href="/docs/contribute/blog/#maintenance">article updates and maintenance</a>
as part of the message you send when you close the PR.</p><p>It is OK to make an exception where a relevant justification applies.</p><h3 id="support-requests-or-code-bug-reports">Support requests or code bug reports</h3><p>Some docs issues are actually issues with the underlying code, or requests for
assistance when something, for example a tutorial, doesn't work.
For issues unrelated to docs, close the issue with the <code>kind/support</code> label and a comment
directing the requester to support venues (Slack, Stack Overflow) and, if
relevant, the repository to file an issue for bugs with features (<code>kubernetes/kubernetes</code>
is a great place to start).</p><p>Sample response to a request for support:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-none">This issue sounds more like a request for support and less

where you might do the following:</p><ul><li>Advise the contributor to squash their commits.</li><li>Squash the commits for the contributor.</li><li>Advise the contributor not to squash yet.</li><li>Prevent squashing.</li></ul><p><strong>Advising contributors to squash</strong>: A new contributor might not know that they
should squash commits in their pull requests (PRs). If this is the case, advise
them to do so, provide links to useful information, and offer to arrange help if
they need it. Some useful links:</p><ul><li><a href="/docs/contribute/new-content/open-a-pr/#squashing-commits">Opening pull requests and squashing your commits</a>
for documentation contributors.</li><li><a href="https://www.k8s.dev/docs/guide/github-workflow/">GitHub Workflow</a>, including diagrams, for developers.</li></ul><p><strong>Squashing commits for contributors</strong>: If a contributor might have difficulty
squashing commits or there is time pressure to merge a PR, you can perform the
squash for them:</p><ul><li>The kubernetes/website repo is
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-squashing-for-pull-requests">configured to allow squashing for pull request merges</a>.
Simply select the <em>Squash commits</em> button.</li><li>In the PR, if the contributor enables maintainers to manage the PR, you can
squash their commits and update their fork with the result. Before you squash,
advise them to save and push their latest changes to the PR. After you squash,
advise them to pull the squashed commit to their local clone.</li><li>You can get GitHub to squash the commits by using a label so that Tide / GitHub
performs the squash or by clicking the <em>Squash commits</em> button when you merge the PR.</li></ul><p><strong>Advise contributors to avoid squashing</strong></p><ul><li>If one commit does something broken or unwise, and the last commit reverts this
error, don't squash the commits. Even though the "Files changed" tab in the PR
on GitHub and the Netlify preview will both look OK, merging this PR might create
rebase or merge conflicts for other folks. Intervene as you see fit to avoid that
risk to other contributors.</li></ul><p><strong>Never squash</strong></p><ul><li>If you're launching a localization or releasing the docs for a new version,
you are merging in a branch that's not from a user's fork, <em>never squash the commits</em>.
Not squashing is essential because you must maintain the commit history for those files.</li></ul></div></div><div><div class="td-content"><h1>Localizing Kubernetes documentation</h1><p>This page shows you how to

to find your localization's two-letter language code. For example, the
two-letter code for Korean is <code>ko</code>.</p><p>If the language you are starting a localization for is spoken in various places
with significant differences between the variants, it might make sense to
combine the lowercased ISO-3166 country code with the language two-letter code.
For example, Brazilian Portuguese is localized as <code>pt-br</code>.</p><p>When you start a new localization, you must localize all the

these are much easier for a localization team to edit. If you find a raster
image that needs localizing, consider first redrawing the English version as
a vector image, and then localize that.</p><p>When translating text within SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) images, it's
essential to follow certain guidelines to ensure accuracy and maintain
consistency across different language versions. SVG images are commonly
used in the Kubernetes documentation to illustrate concepts, workflows,
and diagrams.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Identifying translatable text</strong>: Start by identifying the text elements
within the SVG image that need to be translated. These elements typically
include labels, captions, annotations, or any text that conveys information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Editing SVG files</strong>: SVG files are XML-based, which means they can be
edited using a text editor. However, it's important to note that most of the
documentation images in Kubernetes already convert text to curves to avoid font
compatibility issues. In such cases, it is recommended to use specialized SVG
editing software, such as Inkscape, for editing, open the SVG file and locate
the text elements that require translation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Translating the text</strong>: Replace the original text with the translated
version in the desired language. Ensure the translated text accurately conveys
the intended meaning and fits within the available space in the image. The Open
Sans font family should be used when working with languages that use the Latin
alphabet. You can download the Open Sans typeface from here:
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans">Open Sans Typeface</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Converting text to curves</strong>: As already mentioned, to address font
compatibility issues, it is recommended to convert the translated text to
curves or paths. Converting text to curves ensures that the final image
displays the translated text correctly, even if the user's system does not
have the exact font used in the original SVG.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reviewing and testing</strong>: After making the necessary translations and
converting text to curves, save and review the updated SVG image to ensure
the text is properly displayed and aligned. Check

<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website">https://github.com/kubernetes/website</a>.</p></li><li><p>Select a branch for your target version from the following table:</p></li></ol><table><thead><tr><th>Target version</th><th>Branch</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Latest version</td><td><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/main"><code>main</code></a></td></tr><tr><td>Previous version</td><td><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/release-1.33"><code>release-1.33</code></a></td></tr><tr><td>Next version</td><td><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/dev-1.35"><code>dev-1.35</code></a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The <code>main</code> branch holds content for the current release <code>v1.34</code>.
The release team creates a <code>release-1.34</code> branch before the next
release: v1.35.</p><h3 id="site-strings-in-i18n">Site strings in i18n</h3><p>Localizations must include the contents of
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/main/i18n/en/en.toml"><code>i18n/en/en.toml</code></a>
in a new language-specific file. Using German as an example:
<code>i18n/de/de.toml</code>.</p><p>Add a new localization directory and file to <code>i18n/</code>. For example, with
German (<code>de</code>):</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span><span>mkdir -p i18n/de
</span></span><span><span>cp i18n/en/en.toml i18n/de/de.toml
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Revise the comments at the top of the file to suit your localization, then
translate the value of each string. For example, this is the German-language
placeholder text for the search form:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-toml"><span><span>[ui_search]
</span></span><span><span>other = <span>"Suchen"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Localizing site strings lets you customize site-wide text and features: for
example, the legal copyright text in the footer on each page.</p><h3 id="language-specific-localization-guide">Language-specific localization guide</h3><p>As a localization team, you can formalize the best practices your team follows
by creating a language-specific localization guide.</p><p>For example, see the
<a href="/ko/docs/contribute/localization_ko/">Korean Localization Guide</a>, which
includes content on the following subjects:</p><ul><li>Sprint cadence and releases</li><li>Branch strategy</li><li>Pull request workflow</li><li>Style guide</li><li>Glossary of localized and non-localized terms</li><li>Markdown conventions</li><li>Kubernetes API object terminology</li></ul><h3 id="language-specific-zoom-meetings">Language-specific Zoom meetings</h3><p>If the localization project needs a separate meeting time, contact a SIG Docs
Co-Chair or Tech Lead to create a new reoccurring Zoom meeting and calendar
invite. This is only needed when the team is large enough to sustain and require
a separate meeting.</p><p>Per CNCF policy, the localization teams must upload their meetings to the SIG
Docs YouTube playlist. A SIG Docs Co-Chair or Tech Lead can help with the
process until SIG Docs automates it.</p><h2 id="branch-strategy">Branch strategy</h2><p>Because localization projects are highly collaborative efforts, we
encourage teams to work in shared localization branches - especially
when starting out and the localization is not yet live.</p><p>To collaborate on a localization branch:</p><ol><li><p>A team member of
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/website-maintainers">@kubernetes/website-maintainers</a>
opens a localization branch from a source branch on
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website">https://github.com/kubernetes/website</a>.</p><p>Your team approvers joined the <code>@kubernetes/website-maintainers</code> team when
you <a href="#add-your-localization-team-in-github">added your localization team</a> to
the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/org"><code>kubernetes/org</code></a> repository.</p><p>We recommend the following branch naming scheme:</p><p><code>dev-&lt;source version&gt;-&lt;language code&gt;.&lt;team milestone&gt;</code></p><p>For example, an approver on a German localization team opens the localization
branch <code>dev-1.12-de.1</code> directly against the <code>kubernetes/website</code> repository,
based on the source branch for Kubernetes v1.12.</p></li><li><p>Individual contributors open feature branches based on the localization
branch.</p><p>For example, a German contributor opens a pull request with changes to
<code>kubernetes:dev-1.12-de.1</code> from <code>username:local-branch-name</code>.</p></li><li><p>Approvers review and merge feature branches into the localization branch.</p></li><li><p>Periodically, an approver merges the localization branch with its source
branch by opening and approving a new pull request. Be sure to squash the
commits before approving the pull request.</p></li></ol><p>Repeat steps 1-4 as needed until the localization is complete. For example,
subsequent German localization branches would be: <code>dev-1.12-de.2</code>,
<code>dev-1.12-de.3</code>, etc.</p><p>Teams must merge localized content into the same branch from which the content
was sourced. For example:</p><ul><li>A localization branch sourced from <code>main</code> must be merged into <code>main</code>.</li><li>A localization branch sourced from <code>release-1.33</code>
must be merged into <code>release-1.33</code>.</li></ul><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>If your localization branch was created from <code>main</code> branch, but it is not merged
into <code>main</code> before the new release branch <code>release-1.34</code> created,
merge it into both <code>main</code> and new release branch <code>release-1.34</code>. To
merge your localization branch into the new release branch
<code>release-1.34</code>, you need to switch the upstream branch of your
localization branch to <code>release-1.34</code>.</div><p>At the beginning of every team milestone, it's helpful to open an issue
comparing upstream changes between the previous localization branch and the
current localization branch. There are two scripts for comparing upstream
changes.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/main/scripts#upstream_changespy"><code>upstream_changes.py</code></a>
is useful for checking the changes made to a specific file. And</li><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/main/scripts#diff_l10n_branchespy"><code>diff_l10n_branches.py</code></a>
is useful for creating a list of outdated files for a specific localization
branch.</li></ul><p>While only approvers can open a new localization branch and merge pull requests,
anyone can open a pull request for a new localization branch. No special
permissions are required.</p><p>For more information about working from forks or directly from the repository,

<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md">special interest groups</a>
within the Kubernetes project, focused on writing, updating, and maintaining
the documentation for Kubernetes as a whole. See
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs">SIG Docs from the community github repo</a>
for more information about the SIG.</p><p>SIG Docs welcomes content and reviews from all contributors. Anyone can open a

<a href="/docs/contribute/participate/roles-and-responsibilities/#reviewers">reviewer</a>, or
<a href="/docs/contribute/participate/roles-and-responsibilities/#approvers">approver</a>.
These roles require greater access and entail certain responsibilities for
approving and committing changes. See
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md">community-membership</a>
for more information on how membership works within the Kubernetes community.</p><p>The rest of this document outlines some unique ways these roles function within
SIG Docs, which is responsible for maintaining one of the most public-facing
aspects of Kubernetes -- the Kubernetes website and documentation.</p><h2 id="sig-docs-chairperson">SIG Docs chairperson</h2><p>Each SIG, including SIG Docs, selects one or more SIG members to act as
chairpersons. These are points of contact between SIG Docs and other parts of
the Kubernetes organization. They require extensive knowledge of the structure
of the Kubernetes project as a whole and how SIG Docs works within it. See
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs#leadership">Leadership</a>
for the current list of chairpersons.</p><h2 id="sig-docs-teams-and-automation">SIG Docs teams and automation</h2><p>Automation in SIG Docs relies on two different mechanisms:
GitHub teams and OWNERS files.</p><h3 id="github-teams">GitHub teams</h3><p>There are two categories of SIG Docs <a href="https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams?query=sig-docs">teams</a> on GitHub:</p><ul><li><code>@sig-docs-{language}-owners</code> are approvers and leads</li><li><code>@sig-docs-{language}-reviews</code> are reviewers</li></ul><p>Each can be referenced with their <code>@name</code> in GitHub comments to communicate with
everyone in that group.</p><p>Sometimes Prow and GitHub teams overlap without matching exactly. For
assignment of issues, pull requests, and to support PR approvals, the
automation uses information from <code>OWNERS</code> files.</p><h3 id="owners-files-and-front-matter">OWNERS files and front-matter</h3><p>The Kubernetes project uses an automation tool called prow for automation
related to GitHub issues and pull requests. The
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website">Kubernetes website repository</a> uses
two <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prow/tree/main/pkg/plugins">prow plugins</a>:</p><ul><li>blunderbuss</li><li>approve</li></ul><p>These two plugins use the
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/main/OWNERS">OWNERS</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/main/OWNERS_ALIASES">OWNERS_ALIASES</a>
files in the top level of the <code>kubernetes/website</code> GitHub repository to control
how prow works within the repository.</p><p>An OWNERS file contains a list of people who are SIG Docs reviewers and
approvers. OWNERS files can also exist in subdirectories, and can override who
can act as a reviewer or approver of files in that subdirectory and its
descendants. For more information about OWNERS files in general, see
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/owners.md">OWNERS</a>.</p><p>In addition, an individual Markdown file can list reviewers and approvers in its
front-matter, either by listing individual GitHub usernames or GitHub groups.</p><p>The combination of OWNERS files and front-matter in Markdown files determines
the advice PR owners get from automated systems about who to ask for technical
and editorial review of their PR.</p><h2 id="how-merging-works">How merging works</h2><p>When a pull request is merged to the branch used to publish content, that content is published to <a href="https://kubernetes.io">https://kubernetes.io</a>. To ensure that
the quality of our published content is high, we limit merging pull requests to
SIG Docs approvers. Here's how it works.</p><ul><li>When a pull request has both the <code>lgtm</code> and <code>approve</code> labels, has no <code>hold</code>
labels, and all tests are passing, the pull request merges automatically.</li><li>Kubernetes organization members and SIG Docs approvers can add comments to
prevent automatic merging of a given pull request (by adding a <code>/hold</code> comment
or withholding a <code>/lgtm</code> comment).</li><li>Any Kubernetes member can add the <code>lgtm</code> label by adding a <code>/lgtm</code> comment.</li><li>Only SIG Docs approvers can merge a pull request
by adding an <code>/approve</code> comment. Some approvers also perform additional
specific roles, such as <a href="/docs/contribute/participate/pr-wranglers/">PR Wrangler</a> or

<a class="glossary-tooltip" title="An abstraction used by Kubernetes to support isolation of groups of resources within a single cluster." href="/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces" target="_blank">namespace</a> is a resource -
the same way that all web URLs identify a resource.</p><p>Kubernetes documentation also uses "resource" to talk about CPU and memory
requests and limits. It's very often a good idea to refer to API resources
as "API resources"; that helps to avoid confusion with CPU and memory resources,
or with other kinds of resource.</p><p>If you are using the lowercase plural form of a resource name, such as
<code>deployments</code> or <code>configmaps</code>, provide extra written context to help readers
understand what you mean. If you are using the term in a context where the
UpperCamelCase name could work too, and there is a risk of ambiguity,
consider using the API kind in UpperCamelCase.</p><h3 id="when-to-use-kubernetes-api-terminologies">When to use Kubernetes API terminologies</h3><p>The different Kubernetes API terminologies are:</p><ul><li><em>API kinds</em>: the name used in the API URL (such as <code>pods</code>, <code>namespaces</code>).
API kinds are sometimes also called <em>resource types</em>.</li><li><em>API resource</em>: a single instance of an API kind (such as <code>pod</code>, <code>secret</code>).</li><li><em>Object</em>: a resource that serves as a "record of intent". An object is a desired
state for a specific part of your cluster, which the Kubernetes control plane tries to maintain.
All objects in the Kubernetes API are also resources.</li></ul><p>For clarity, you can add "resource" or "object" when referring to an API resource in Kubernetes
documentation.
An example: write "a Secret object" instead of "a Secret".
If it is clear just from the capitalization, you don't need to add the extra word.</p><p>Consider rephrasing when that change helps avoid misunderstandings. A common situation is
when you want to start a sentence with an API kind, such as &#8220;Secret&#8221;; because English
and other languages capitalize at the start of sentences, readers cannot tell whether you
mean the API kind or the general concept. Rewording can help.</p><h3 id="api-resource-names">API resource names</h3><p>Always format API resource names using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">UpperCamelCase</a>,
also known as PascalCase. Do not write API kinds with code formatting.</p><p>Don't split an API object name into separate words. For example, use PodTemplateList, not Pod Template List.</p><p>For more information about PascalCase and code formatting, review the related guidance on

Verify that any topics using the standalone YAML have the appropriate version information defined.
If a stand-alone YAML file is not referenced from any topics, consider deleting it instead of updating it.</p><p>For example, if you are writing a tutorial that is relevant to Kubernetes version 1.8,

You must insert them
in the parent document, before and after you call the include. For example:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>{{&lt; note &gt;}}
{{&lt; include "task-tutorial-prereqs.md" &gt;}}
{{&lt; /note &gt;}}
</code></pre><h2 id="markdown-elements">Markdown elements</h2><h3 id="line-breaks">Line breaks</h3><p>Use a single newline to separate block-level content like headings, lists, images,
code blocks, and others. The exception is second-level headings, where it should
be two newlines. Second-level headings follow the first-level (or the title) without
any preceding paragraphs or texts. A two line spacing helps visualize the overall
structure of content in a code editor better.</p><p>Manually wrap paragraphs in the Markdown source when appropriate. Since the git
tool and the GitHub website generate file diffs on a line-by-line basis,
manually wrapping long lines helps the reviewers to easily find out the changes
made in a PR and provide feedback. It also helps the downstream localization
teams where people track the upstream changes on a per-line basis. Line
wrapping can happen at the end of a sentence or a punctuation character, for
example. One exception to this is that a Markdown link or a shortcode is
expected to be in a single line.</p><h3 id="headings">Headings and titles</h3><p>People accessing this documentation may use a screen reader or other assistive technology (AT).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">Screen readers</a> are linear output devices,
they output items on a page one at a time. If there is a lot of content on a page, you can
use headings to give the page an internal structure. A good page structure helps all readers
to easily navigate the page or filter topics of interest.</p><table><caption>Do and Don't - Headings</caption><thead><tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Update the title in the front matter of the page or blog post.</td><td>Use first level heading, as Hugo automatically converts the title in the front matter of the page into a first-level heading.</td></tr><tr><td>Use ordered headings to provide a meaningful high-level outline of your content.</td><td>Use headings level 4 through 6, unless it is absolutely necessary. If your content is that detailed, it may need to be broken into separate articles.</td></tr><tr><td>Use pound or hash signs (<code>#</code>) for non-blog post content.</td><td>Use underlines (<code>---</code> or <code>===</code>) to designate first-level headings.</td></tr><tr><td>Use sentence case for headings in the page body. For example, <strong>Extend kubectl with plugins</strong></td><td>Use title case for headings in the page body. For example, <strong>Extend Kubectl With Plugins</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Use title case for the page title in the front matter. For example, <code>title: Kubernetes API Server Bypass Risks</code></td><td>Use sentence case for page titles in the front matter. For example, don't use <code>title: Kubernetes API server bypass risks</code></td></tr><tr><td>Place relevant links in the body copy.</td><td>Include hyperlinks (<code>&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>) in headings.</td></tr><tr><td>Use pound or hash signs (<code>#</code>) to indicate headings.</td><td>Use <strong>bold</strong> text or other indicators to split paragraphs.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h3><table><caption>Do and Don't - Paragraphs</caption><thead><tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Try to keep paragraphs under 6 sentences.</td><td>Indent the first paragraph with space characters. For example, &#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Three spaces before a paragraph will indent it.</td></tr><tr><td>Use three hyphens (<code>---</code>) to create a horizontal rule. Use horizontal rules for breaks in paragraph content. For example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.</td><td>Use horizontal rules for decoration.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="links">Links</h3><table><caption>Do and Don't - Links</caption><thead><tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Write hyperlinks that give you context for the content they link to. For example: Certain ports are open on your machines. See <a href="#check-required-ports">Check required ports</a> for more details.</td><td>Use ambiguous terms such as "click here". For example: Certain ports are open on your machines. See <a href="#check-required-ports">here</a> for more details.</td></tr><tr><td>Write Markdown-style links: <code>[link text](URL)</code>. For example: <code>[Hugo shortcodes](/docs/contribute/style/hugo-shortcodes/#table-captions)</code> and the output is <a href="/docs/contribute/style/hugo-shortcodes/#table-captions">Hugo shortcodes</a>.</td><td>Write HTML-style links: <code>&lt;a href="/media/examples/link-element-example.css" target="_blank"&gt;Visit our tutorial!&lt;/a&gt;</code>, or create links that open in new tabs or windows. For example: <code>[example website](https://example.com){target="_blank"}</code></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="lists">Lists</h3><p>Group items in a list that are related to each other and need to appear in a specific
order or to indicate a correlation between multiple items. When a screen reader comes
across a list&#8212;whether it is an ordered or unordered list&#8212;it will be announced to the
user that there is a group of list items. The user can then use the arrow keys to move
up and down between the various items in the list. Website navigation links can also be
marked up as list items; after all they are nothing but a group of related links.</p><ul><li><p>End each item in a list with a period if one or more items in the list are complete
sentences. For the sake of consistency, normally either all items or none should be complete sentences.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>Ordered lists that are part of an incomplete introductory sentence can be in lowercase
and punctuated as if each item was a part of the introductory sentence.</div></li><li><p>Use the number one (<code>1.</code>) for ordered lists.</p></li><li><p>Use (<code>+</code>), (<code>*</code>), or (<code>-</code>) for unordered lists.</p></li><li><p>Leave a blank line after each list.</p></li><li><p>Indent nested lists with four spaces (for example, &#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;).</p></li><li><p>List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent paragraph in a list
item must be indented by either four spaces or one tab.</p></li></ul><h3 id="tables">Tables</h3><p>The semantic purpose of a data table is to present tabular data. Sighted users can
quickly scan the table but a screen reader goes through line by line. A table caption
is used to create a descriptive title for a data table. Assistive technologies (AT)
use the HTML table caption element to identify the table contents to the user within the page structure.</p><ul><li>Add table captions using <a href="/docs/contribute/style/hugo-shortcodes/#table-captions">Hugo shortcodes</a> for tables.</li></ul><h2 id="content-best-practices">Content best practices</h2><p>This section contains suggested best practices for clear, concise, and consistent content.</p><h3 id="use-present-tense">Use present tense</h3><table><caption>Do and Don't - Use present tense</caption><thead><tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>This command starts a proxy.</td><td>This command will start a proxy.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Exception: Use future or past tense if it is required to convey the correct

diagram in the Mermaid live editor.</div><h2 id="why-you-should-use-diagrams-in-documentation">Why you should use diagrams in documentation</h2><p>Diagrams improve documentation clarity and comprehension. There are advantages for both the user and the contributor.</p><p>The user benefits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Friendly landing spot</strong>. A detailed text-only greeting page could
intimidate users, in particular, first-time Kubernetes users.</li><li><strong>Faster grasp of concepts</strong>. A diagram can help users understand the key
points of a complex topic. Your diagram can serve as a visual learning guide
to dive into the topic details.</li><li><strong>Better retention</strong>. For some, it is easier to recall pictures rather than text.</li></ul><p>The contributor benefits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Assist in developing the structure and content</strong> of your contribution. For
example, you can start with a simple diagram covering the high-level points
and then dive into details.</li><li><strong>Expand and grow the user community</strong>. Easily consumed documentation
augmented with diagrams attracts new users who might previously have been
reluctant to engage due to perceived complexities.</li></ul><p>You should consider your target audience. In addition to experienced K8s
users, you will have many who are new to Kubernetes. Even a simple diagram can
assist new users in absorbing Kubernetes concepts. They become emboldened and
more confident to further explore Kubernetes and the documentation.</p><h2 id="mermaid">Mermaid</h2><p><a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">Mermaid</a> is an open source
JavaScript library that allows you to create, edit and easily share diagrams
using a simple, markdown-like syntax configured inline in Markdown files.</p><p>The following lists features of Mermaid:</p><ul><li>Simple code syntax.</li><li>Includes a web-based tool allowing you to code and preview your diagrams.</li><li>Supports multiple formats including flowchart, state and sequence.</li><li>Easy collaboration with colleagues by sharing a per-diagram URL.</li><li>Broad selection of shapes, lines, themes and styling.</li></ul><p>The following lists advantages of using Mermaid:</p><ul><li>No need for separate, non-Mermaid diagram tools.</li><li>Adheres to existing PR workflow. You can think of Mermaid code as just
Markdown text included in your PR.</li><li>Simple tool builds simple diagrams. You don't want to get bogged down
(re)crafting an overly complex and detailed picture. Keep it simple!</li></ul><p>Mermaid provides a simple, open and transparent method for the SIG communities
to add, edit and collaborate on diagrams for new or existing documentation.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>You can still use Mermaid to create/edit diagrams even if it's not supported

a web-based tool that enables you to create, edit and review diagrams.</p><p>The following lists live editor functions:</p><ul><li>Displays Mermaid code and rendered diagram.</li><li>Generates a URL for each saved diagram. The URL is displayed in the URL

of the diagram are examples of captions. Captions aren't meant to replace
explanatory text you have in your documentation. Rather, they serve as a
"context link" between that text and your diagram.</p><p>The combination of some text and a diagram tied together with a caption help
provide a concise representation of the information you wish to convey to the
user.</p><p>Without captions, you are asking the user to scan the text above or below the
diagram to figure out a meaning. This can be frustrating for the user.</p><p>Figure 9 lays out the three components for proper captioning: diagram, diagram

appears in the documentation.</p></li><li><p>Include diagram source pointers such as a URL, source code location, or
indicate the code is self-documenting.</p></li><li><p>Always use diagram captions.</p></li><li><p>Very helpful to include the diagram <code>.svg</code> or <code>.png</code> image and/or Mermaid
source code in issues and PRs.</p></li><li><p>With the <code>Mermaid+SVG</code> and <code>External Tool</code> methods, use <code>.svg</code> image files
because they stay sharp when you zoom in on the diagram.</p></li><li><p>Best practice for <code>.svg</code> files is to load it into an SVG editing tool and use the
"Convert text to paths" function.
This ensures that the diagram renders the same on all systems, regardless of font
availability and font rendering support.</p></li><li><p>No Mermaid support for additional icons or artwork.</p></li><li><p>Hugo Mermaid shortcodes don't work in the live editor.</p></li><li><p>Any time you modify a diagram in the live editor, you <strong>must</strong> save it
to generate a new URL for the diagram.</p></li><li><p>Click on the diagrams in this section to view the code and diagram rendering
in the live editor.</p></li><li><p>Look over the source code of this page, <code>diagram-guide.md</code>, for more examples.</p></li><li><p>Check out the <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">Mermaid docs</a>

<a href="/docs/contribute/new-content/open-a-pr/">Open a PR</a>.</p><h2 id="choosing-a-page-type">Choosing a page type</h2><p>As you prepare to write a new topic, think about the page type that would fit your content the best:</p><table><caption>Guidelines for choosing a page type</caption><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Concept</td><td>A concept page explains some aspect of Kubernetes. For example, a concept page might describe the Kubernetes Deployment object and explain the role it plays as an application while it is deployed, scaled, and updated. Typically, concept pages don't include sequences of steps, but instead provide links to tasks or tutorials. For an example of a concept topic, see <a href="/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/">Nodes</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Task</td><td>A task page shows how to do a single thing. The idea is to give readers a sequence of steps that they can actually do as they read the page. A task page can be short or long, provided it stays focused on one area. In a task page, it is OK to blend brief explanations with the steps to be performed, but if you need to provide a lengthy explanation, you should do that in a concept topic. Related task and concept topics should link to each other. For an example of a short task page, see <a href="/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-volume-storage/">Configure a Pod to Use a Volume for Storage</a>. For an example of a longer task page, see <a href="/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/">Configure Liveness and Readiness Probes</a></td></tr><tr><td>Tutorial</td><td>A tutorial page shows how to accomplish a goal that ties together several Kubernetes features. A tutorial might provide several sequences of steps that readers can actually do as they read the page. Or it might provide explanations of related pieces of code. For example, a tutorial could provide a walkthrough of a code sample. A tutorial can include brief explanations of the Kubernetes features that are being tied together, but should link to related concept topics for deep explanations of individual features.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="creating-a-new-page">Creating a new page</h3><p>Use a <a href="/docs/contribute/style/page-content-types/">content type</a> for each new page
that you write. The docs site provides templates or
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/">Hugo archetypes</a> to create
new content pages. To create a new type of page, run <code>hugo new</code> with the path to the file
you want to create. For example:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>hugo new docs/concepts/my-first-concept.md
</code></pre><h2 id="choosing-a-title-and-filename">Choosing a title and filename</h2><p>Choose a title that has the keywords you want search engines to find.
Create a filename that uses the words in your title separated by hyphens.
For example, the topic with title
<a href="/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/http-proxy-access-api/">Using an HTTP Proxy to Access the Kubernetes API</a>
has filename <code>http-proxy-access-api.md</code>. You don't need to put
"kubernetes" in the filename, because "kubernetes" is already in the
URL for the topic, for example:</p><pre><code>   /docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/http-proxy-access-api/
</code></pre><h2 id="adding-the-topic-title-to-the-front-matter">Adding the topic title to the front matter</h2><p>In your topic, put a <code>title</code> field in the
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">front matter</a>.
The front matter is the YAML block that is between the
triple-dashed lines at the top of the page. Here's an example:</p><pre><code>---
title: Using an HTTP Proxy to Access the Kubernetes API
---
</code></pre><h2 id="choosing-a-directory">Choosing a directory</h2><p>Depending on your page type, put your new file in a subdirectory of one of these:</p><ul><li>/content/en/docs/tasks/</li><li>/content/en/docs/tutorials/</li><li>/content/en/docs/concepts/</li></ul><p>You can put your file in an existing subdirectory, or you can create a new
subdirectory.</p><h2 id="placing-your-topic-in-the-table-of-contents">Placing your topic in the table of contents</h2><p>The table of contents is built dynamically using the directory structure of the
documentation source. The top-level directories under <code>/content/en/docs/</code> create
top-level navigation, and subdirectories each have entries in the table of
contents.</p><p>Each subdirectory has a file <code>_index.md</code>, which represents the "home" page for
a given subdirectory's content. The <code>_index.md</code> does not need a template. It
can contain overview content about the topics in the subdirectory.</p><p>Other files in a directory are sorted alphabetically by default. This is almost
never the best order. To control the relative sorting of topics in a
subdirectory, set the <code>weight:</code> front-matter key to an integer. Typically, we
use multiples of 10, to account for adding topics later. For instance, a topic
with weight <code>10</code> will come before one with weight <code>20</code>.</p><h2 id="embedding-code-in-your-topic">Embedding code in your topic</h2><p>If you want to include some code in your topic, you can embed the code in your
file directly using the markdown code block syntax. This is recommended for the
following cases (not an exhaustive list):</p><ul><li>The code shows the output from a command such as
<code>kubectl get deploy mydeployment -o json | jq '.status'</code>.</li><li>The code is not generic enough for users to try out. As an example, you can
embed the YAML
file for creating a Pod which depends on a specific
<a href="/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#flexvolume">FlexVolume</a> implementation.</li><li>The code is an incomplete example because its purpose is to highlight a
portion of a larger file. For example, when describing ways to
customize a <a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-binding-examples">RoleBinding</a>,
you can provide a short snippet directly in your topic file.</li><li>The code is not meant for users to try out due to other reasons. For example,
when describing how a new attribute should be added to a resource using the
<code>kubectl edit</code> command, you can provide a short example that includes only
the attribute to add.</li></ul><h2 id="including-code-from-another-file">Including code from another file</h2><p>Another way to include code in your topic is to create a new, complete sample
file (or group of sample files) and then reference the sample from your topic.
Use this method to include sample YAML files when the sample is generic and
reusable, and you want the reader to try it out themselves.</p><p>When adding a new standalone sample file, such as a YAML file, place the code in
one of the <code>&lt;LANG&gt;/examples/</code> subdirectories where <code>&lt;LANG&gt;</code> is the language for
the topic. In your topic file, use the <code>code_sample</code> shortcode:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-none">{{% code_sample file="&lt;RELPATH&gt;/my-example-yaml&gt;" %}}
</code></pre><p>where <code>&lt;RELPATH&gt;</code> is the path to the file to include, relative to the
<code>examples</code> directory. The following Hugo shortcode references a YAML
file located at <code>/content/en/examples/pods/storage/gce-volume.yaml</code>.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-none">{{% code_sample file="pods/storage/gce-volume.yaml" %}}
</code></pre><h2 id="showing-how-to-create-an-api-object-from-a-configuration-file">Showing how to create an API object from a configuration file</h2><p>If you need to demonstrate how to create an API object based on a
configuration file, place the configuration file in one of the subdirectories
under <code>&lt;LANG&gt;/examples</code>.</p><p>In your topic, show this command:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/storage/gce-volume.yaml
</code></pre><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>When adding new YAML files to the <code>&lt;LANG&gt;/examples</code> directory, make
sure the file is also included into the <code>&lt;LANG&gt;/examples_test.go</code> file. The
Travis CI for the Website automatically runs this test case when PRs are
submitted to ensure all examples pass the tests.</div><p>For an example of a topic that uses this technique, see
<a href="/docs/tasks/run-application/run-single-instance-stateful-application/">Running a Single-Instance Stateful Application</a>.</p><h2 id="adding-images-to-a-topic">Adding images to a topic</h2><p>Put image files in the <code>/images</code> directory. The preferred

Markdown comments and HTML headings. You can add content headings to
your page with the <code>heading</code> shortcode. The comments and headings help
maintain the structure of the page content types.</p><p>Examples of Markdown comments defining page content sections:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-markdown"><span><span><span>&lt;!-- overview --&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-markdown"><span><span><span>&lt;!-- body --&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To create common headings in your content pages, use the <code>heading</code> shortcode with
a heading string.</p><p>Examples of heading strings:</p><ul><li>whatsnext</li><li>prerequisites</li><li>objectives</li><li>cleanup</li><li>synopsis</li><li>seealso</li><li>options</li></ul><p>For example, to create a <code>whatsnext</code> heading, add the heading shortcode with the "whatsnext" string:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-none">## {{% heading "whatsnext" %}}
</code></pre><p>You can declare a <code>prerequisites</code> heading as follows:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-none">## {{% heading "prerequisites" %}}
</code></pre><p>The <code>heading</code> shortcode expects one string parameter.
The heading string parameter matches the prefix of a variable in the <code>i18n/&lt;lang&gt;/&lt;lang&gt;.toml</code> files.
For example:</p><p><code>i18n/en/en.toml</code>:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-toml"><span><span>[whatsnext_heading]
</span></span><span><span>other = <span>"What's next"</span>

</span></span><span><span>other = <span>"&#45796;&#51020; &#45236;&#50857;"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="content-types">Content types</h2><p>Each content type informally defines its expected page structure.
Create page content with the suggested page sections.</p><h3 id="concept">Concept</h3><p>A concept page explains some aspect of Kubernetes. For example, a concept
page might describe the Kubernetes Deployment object and explain the role it
plays as an application once it is deployed, scaled, and updated. Typically, concept
pages don't include sequences of steps, but instead provide links to tasks or
tutorials.</p><p>To write a new concept page, create a Markdown file in a subdirectory of the
<code>/content/en/docs/concepts</code> directory, with the following characteristics:</p><p>Concept pages are divided into three sections:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Page section</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>overview</td></tr><tr><td>body</td></tr><tr><td>whatsnext</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The <code>overview</code> and <code>body</code> sections appear as comments in the concept page.
You can add the <code>whatsnext</code> section to your page with the <code>heading</code> shortcode.</p><p>Fill each section with content. Follow these guidelines:</p><ul><li>Organize content with H2 and H3 headings.</li><li>For <code>overview</code>, set the topic's context with a single paragraph.</li><li>For <code>body</code>, explain the concept.</li><li>For <code>whatsnext</code>, provide a bulleted list of topics (5 maximum) to learn more about the concept.</li></ul><p><a href="/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/">Annotations</a> is a published example of a concept page.</p><h3 id="task">Task</h3><p>A task page shows how to do a single thing, typically by giving a short
sequence of steps. Task pages have minimal explanation, but often provide links
to conceptual topics that provide related background and knowledge.</p><p>To write a new task page, create a Markdown file in a subdirectory of the
<code>/content/en/docs/tasks</code> directory, with the following characteristics:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Page section</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>overview</td></tr><tr><td>prerequisites</td></tr><tr><td>steps</td></tr><tr><td>discussion</td></tr><tr><td>whatsnext</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The <code>overview</code>, <code>steps</code>, and <code>discussion</code> sections appear as comments in the task page.
You can add the <code>prerequisites</code> and <code>whatsnext</code> sections to your page
with the <code>heading</code> shortcode.</p><p>Within each section, write your content. Use the following guidelines:</p><ul><li>Use a minimum of H2 headings (with two leading <code>#</code> characters). The sections
themselves are titled automatically by the template.</li><li>For <code>overview</code>, use a paragraph to set context for the entire topic.</li><li>For <code>prerequisites</code>, use bullet lists when possible. Start adding additional
prerequisites below the <code>include</code>. The default prerequisites include a running Kubernetes cluster.</li><li>For <code>steps</code>, use numbered lists.</li><li>For discussion, use normal content to expand upon the information covered
in <code>steps</code>.</li><li>For <code>whatsnext</code>, give a bullet list of up to 5 topics the reader might be
interested in reading next.</li></ul><p>An example of a published task topic is <a href="/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/http-proxy-access-api/">Using an HTTP proxy to access the Kubernetes API</a>.</p><h3 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h3><p>A tutorial page shows how to accomplish a goal that is larger than a single
task. Typically a tutorial page has several sections, each of which has a
sequence of steps. For example, a tutorial might provide a walkthrough of a
code sample that illustrates a certain feature of Kubernetes. Tutorials can
include surface-level explanations, but should link to related concept topics
for deep explanations.</p><p>To write a new tutorial page, create a Markdown file in a subdirectory of the
<code>/content/en/docs/tutorials</code> directory, with the following characteristics:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Page section</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>overview</td></tr><tr><td>prerequisites</td></tr><tr><td>objectives</td></tr><tr><td>lessoncontent</td></tr><tr><td>cleanup</td></tr><tr><td>whatsnext</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The <code>overview</code>, <code>objectives</code>, and <code>lessoncontent</code> sections appear as comments in the tutorial page.
You can add the <code>prerequisites</code>, <code>cleanup</code>, and <code>whatsnext</code> sections to your page
with the <code>heading</code> shortcode.</p><p>Within each section, write your content. Use the following guidelines:</p><ul><li>Use a minimum of H2 headings (with two leading <code>#</code> characters). The sections
themselves are titled automatically by the template.</li><li>For <code>overview</code>, use a paragraph to set context for the entire topic.</li><li>For <code>prerequisites</code>, use bullet lists when possible. Add additional
prerequisites below the ones included by default.</li><li>For <code>objectives</code>, use bullet lists.</li><li>For <code>lessoncontent</code>, use a mix of numbered lists and narrative content as
appropriate.</li><li>For <code>cleanup</code>, use numbered lists to describe the steps to clean up the
state of the cluster after finishing the task.</li><li>For <code>whatsnext</code>, give a bullet list of up to 5 topics the reader might be
interested in reading next.</li></ul><p>An example of a published tutorial topic is

Hugo's default sort order, which sorts by weight (from 1), date (newest first),
and finally by the link title.</p><p>Given that, if you want to move a page or a section up, set a weight in the page's front matter:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-yaml"><span><span><span>title</span>:<span> </span>My Page<span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>weight</span>:<span> </span><span>10</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>For page weights, it can be smart not to use 1, 2, 3 ..., but some other interval,
say 10, 20, 30... This allows you to insert pages where you want later.
Additionally, each weight within the same directory (section) should not be
overlapped with the other weights. This makes sure that content is always
organized correctly, especially in localized content.</div><h3 id="documentation-main-menu">Documentation Main Menu</h3><p>The <code>Documentation</code> main menu is built from the sections below <code>docs/</code> with
the <code>main_menu</code> flag set in front matter of the <code>_index.md</code> section content file:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-yaml"><span><span><span>main_menu</span>:<span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that the link title is fetched from the page's <code>linkTitle</code>, so if you want
it to be something different than the title, change it in the content file:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-yaml"><span><span><span>main_menu</span>:<span> </span><span>true</span><span>

it is probably because it is not identified as a section by Hugo. Create a
<code>_index.md</code> content file in the section folder.</div><h3 id="documentation-side-menu">Documentation Side Menu</h3><p>The documentation side-bar menu is built from the <em>current section tree</em> starting below <code>docs/</code>.</p><p>It will show all sections and their pages.</p><p>If you don't want to list a section or page, set the <code>toc_hide</code> flag to <code>true</code> in front matter:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-yaml"><span><span><span>toc_hide</span>:<span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>When you navigate to a section that has content, the specific section or page
(e.g. <code>_index.md</code>) is shown. Else, the first page inside that section is shown.</p><h3 id="documentation-browser">Documentation Browser</h3><p>The page browser on the documentation home page is built using all the sections
and pages that are directly below the <code>docs section</code>.</p><p>If you don't want to list a section or page, set the <code>toc_hide</code> flag to <code>true</code> in front matter:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-yaml"><span><span><span>toc_hide</span>:<span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="the-main-menu">The Main Menu</h3><p>The site links in the top-right menu -- and also in the footer -- are built by
page-lookups. This is to make sure that the page actually exists. So, if the
<code>case-studies</code> section does not exist in a site (language), it will not be linked to.</p><h2 id="page-bundles">Page Bundles</h2><p>In addition to standalone content pages (Markdown files), Hugo supports
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/">Page Bundles</a>.</p><p>One example is <a href="/docs/contribute/style/hugo-shortcodes/">Custom Hugo Shortcodes</a>.
It is considered a <code>leaf bundle</code>. Everything below the directory, including the <code>index.md</code>,
will be part of the bundle. This also includes page-relative links, images that can be processed etc.:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span><span>en/docs/home/contribute/includes

</span></span><span><span>&#9492;&#9472;&#9472; podtemplate.json
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Another widely used example is the <code>includes</code> bundle. It sets <code>headless: true</code> in
front matter, which means that it does not get its own URL. It is only used in other pages.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span><span>en/includes

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Some important notes to the files in the bundles:</p><ul><li>For translated bundles, any missing non-content files will be inherited from
languages above. This avoids duplication.</li><li>All the files in a bundle are what Hugo calls <code>Resources</code> and you can provide
metadata per language, such as parameters and title, even if it does not supports
front matter (YAML files etc.).
See <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-resources/#page-resources-metadata">Page Resources Metadata</a>.</li><li>The value you get from <code>.RelPermalink</code> of a <code>Resource</code> is page-relative.

multiple flavors of a given solution.</p><p>The <code>tabs</code> shortcode takes these parameters:</p><ul><li><code>name</code>: The name as shown on the tab.</li><li><code>codelang</code>: If you provide inner content to the <code>tab</code> shortcode, you can tell Hugo
what code language to use for highlighting.</li><li><code>include</code>: The file to include in the tab. If the tab lives in a Hugo
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/#leaf-bundles">leaf bundle</a>,
the file -- which can be any MIME type supported by Hugo -- is looked up in the bundle itself.
If not, the content page that needs to be included is looked up relative to the current page.
Note that with the <code>include</code>, you do not have any shortcode inner content and must use the
self-closing syntax. For example,
<code>{{&lt; tab name="Content File #1" include="example1" /&gt;}}</code>. The language needs to be specified
under <code>codelang</code> or the language is taken based on the file name.
Non-content files are code-highlighted by default.</li><li>If your inner content is markdown, you must use the <code>%</code>-delimiter to surround the tab.
For example, <code>{{% tab name="Tab 1" %}}This is **markdown**{{% /tab %}}</code></li><li>You can combine the variations mentioned above inside a tab set.</li></ul><p>Below is a demo of the tabs shortcode.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>The tab <strong>name</strong> in a <code>tabs</code> definition must be unique within a content page.</div><h3 id="tabs-demo-code-highlighting">Tabs demo: Code highlighting</h3><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-go-text-template"><span><span><span>{{</span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span>tabs<span> </span>name<span>=</span><span>"tab_with_code"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span>}}</span>

For example, you could run <code>git diff -a api/openapi-spec/swagger.json</code>.
This is important, because <code>swagger.json</code> is the input to the second stage of
the doc generation process.</p><p>Run <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> to commit your changes. Now you have two commits:
one that contains the edited <code>types.go</code> file, and one that contains the generated OpenAPI spec
and related files. Keep these two commits separate. That is, do not squash your commits.</p><p>Submit your changes as a
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">pull request</a> to the

preceding example, the authoritative source file is in the <code>staging</code> directory
in the <code>kubernetes/kubernetes</code> repository. But in your situation,the <code>staging</code> directory
might not be the place to find the authoritative source. For guidance, check the
<code>README</code> files in
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/staging">kubernetes/kubernetes</a>
repository and in related repositories, such as
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/apiserver/blob/master/README.md">kubernetes/apiserver</a>.</div><h3 id="cherry-pick-your-commit-into-a-release-branch">Cherry pick your commit into a release branch</h3><p>In the preceding section, you edited a file in the master branch and then ran scripts
to generate an OpenAPI spec and related files. Then you submitted your changes in a pull request
to the master branch of the kubernetes/kubernetes repository. Now suppose you want to backport
your change into a release branch. For example, suppose the master branch is being used to develop
Kubernetes version 1.34, and you want to backport your change into the
release-1.33 branch.</p><p>Recall that your pull request has two commits: one for editing <code>types.go</code>
and one for the files generated by scripts. The next step is to propose a cherry pick of your first
commit into the release-1.33 branch. The idea is to cherry pick the commit
that edited <code>types.go</code>, but not the commit that has the results of running the scripts. For instructions, see
<a href="https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-release/cherry-picks.md">Propose a Cherry Pick</a>.</p><div class="alert alert-info"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>Proposing a cherry pick requires that you have permission to set a label and a milestone in your
pull request. If you don't have those permissions, you will need to work with someone who can set the label
and milestone for you.</div><p>When you have a pull request in place for cherry picking your one commit into the
release-1.33 branch, the next step is to run these scripts in the
release-1.33 branch of your local environment.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-shell"><span><span>./hack/update-codegen.sh
</span></span><span><span>./hack/update-openapi-spec.sh
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now add a commit to your cherry-pick pull request that has the recently generated OpenAPI spec
and related files. Monitor your pull request until it gets merged into the
release-1.33 branch.</p><p>At this point, both the master branch and the release-1.33 branch have your updated <code>types.go</code>
file and a set of generated files that reflect the change you made to <code>types.go</code>. Note that the
generated OpenAPI spec and other generated files in the release-1.33 branch are not necessarily
the same as the generated files in the master branch. The generated files in the release-1.33 branch
contain API elements only from Kubernetes 1.33. The generated files in the master branch might contain
API elements that are not in 1.33, but are under development for 1.34.</p><h2 id="generate-the-published-reference-docs">Generate the published reference docs</h2><p>The preceding section showed how to edit a source file and then generate

may have ideas for improving the <a href="/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/">Style Guide</a>
, the <a href="/docs/contribute/style/content-guide/">Content Guide</a>, the toolchain used to build
the documentation, the website style, the processes for reviewing and merging
pull requests, or other aspects of the documentation. For maximum transparency,
these types of proposals need to be discussed in a SIG Docs meeting or on the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-docs">kubernetes-sig-docs mailing list</a>.
In addition, it can help to have some context about the way things
currently work and why past decisions have been made before proposing sweeping
changes. The quickest way to get answers to questions about how the documentation
currently works is to ask in the <code>#sig-docs</code> Slack channel on
<a href="https://kubernetes.slack.com">kubernetes.slack.com</a></p><p>After the discussion has taken place and the SIG is in agreement about the desired
outcome, you can work on the proposed changes in the way that is the most
appropriate. For instance, an update to the style guide or the website's
functionality might involve opening a pull request, while a change related to
documentation testing might involve working with sig-testing.</p><h2 id="coordinate-docs-for-a-kubernetes-release">Coordinate docs for a Kubernetes release</h2><p>SIG Docs <a href="/docs/contribute/participate/roles-and-responsibilities/#approvers">approvers</a>

sig-testing and others. To find out more about Kubernetes release processes,
refer to
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release">https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release</a>.</p><p>The SIG Docs representative for a given release coordinates the following tasks:</p><ul><li>Monitor the feature-tracking spreadsheet for new or changed features with an
impact on documentation. If the documentation for a given feature won't be ready
for the release, the feature may not be allowed to go into the release.</li><li>Attend sig-release meetings regularly and give updates on the status of the
docs for the release.</li><li>Review and copyedit feature documentation drafted by the SIG responsible for
