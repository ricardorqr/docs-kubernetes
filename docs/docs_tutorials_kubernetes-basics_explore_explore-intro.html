shared storage (volumes), IP address and information about how to run them.</em></div><p>When you created a Deployment in <a href="/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-app/deploy-intro/">Module 2</a>,
Kubernetes created a <strong>Pod</strong> to host your application instance. A Pod is a Kubernetes
abstraction that represents a group of one or more application containers (such as Docker),
and some shared resources for those containers. Those resources include:</p><ul><li>Shared storage, as Volumes</li><li>Networking, as a unique cluster IP address</li><li>Information about how to run each container, such as the container image version
or specific ports to use</li></ul><p>A Pod models an application-specific "logical host" and can contain different application
containers which are relatively tightly coupled. For example, a Pod might include
both the container with your Node.js app as well as a different container that feeds
the data to be published by the Node.js webserver. The containers in a Pod share an
IP Address and port space, are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared
context on the same Node.</p><p>Pods are the atomic unit on the Kubernetes platform. When we create a Deployment
on Kubernetes, that Deployment creates Pods with containers inside them (as opposed
to creating containers directly). Each Pod is tied to the Node where it is scheduled,
and remains there until termination (according to restart policy) or deletion. In
case of a Node failure, identical Pods are scheduled on other available Nodes in
the cluster.</p><h3 id="pods-overview">Pods overview</h3><figure class="diagram-medium"><img src="/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/public/images/module_03_pods.svg"/></figure><div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert"><em>Containers should only be scheduled together in a single Pod if they are tightly
coupled and need to share resources such as disk.</em></div><h2 id="nodes">Nodes</h2><p>A Pod always runs on a <strong>Node</strong>. A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may
be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each Node is
managed by the control plane. A Node can have multiple pods, and the Kubernetes
control plane automatically handles scheduling the pods across the Nodes in the
cluster. The control plane's automatic scheduling takes into account the available
resources on each Node.</p><p>Every Kubernetes Node runs at least:</p><ul><li><p>Kubelet, a process responsible for communication between the Kubernetes control
plane and the Node; it manages the Pods and the containers running on a machine.</p></li><li><p>A container runtime (like Docker) responsible for pulling the container image
from a registry, unpacking the container, and running the application.</p></li></ul><h3 id="nodes-overview">Nodes overview</h3><figure class="diagram-medium"><img src="/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/public/images/module_03_nodes.svg"/></figure><h2 id="troubleshooting-with-kubectl">Troubleshooting with kubectl</h2><p>In <a href="/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-app/deploy-intro/">Module 2</a>, you used
the kubectl command-line interface. You'll continue to use it in Module 3 to get
information about deployed applications and their environments. The most common
operations can be done with the following kubectl subcommands:</p><ul><li><code>kubectl get</code> - list resources</li><li><code>kubectl describe</code> - show detailed information about a resource</li><li><code>kubectl logs</code> - print the logs from a container in a pod</li><li><code>kubectl exec</code> - execute a command on a container in a pod</li></ul><p>You can use these commands to see when applications were deployed, what their current
statuses are, where they are running and what their configurations are.</p><p>Now that we know more about our cluster components and the command line, let's
explore our application.</p><h3 id="check-application-configuration">Check application configuration</h3><p>Let's verify that the application we deployed in the previous scenario is running.
We'll use the <code>kubectl get</code> command and look for existing Pods:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex"><span>kubectl get pods
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If no pods are running, please wait a couple of seconds and list the Pods again.
You can continue once you see one Pod running.</p><p>Next, to view what containers are inside that Pod and what images are used to build
those containers we run the <code>kubectl describe pods</code> command:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex"><span>kubectl describe pods
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We see here details about the Pod’s container: IP address, the ports used and a
list of events related to the lifecycle of the Pod.</p><p>The output of the <code>describe</code> subcommand is extensive and covers some concepts that
we didn’t explain yet, but don’t worry, they will become familiar by the end of this tutorial.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>The <code>describe</code> subcommand can be used to get detailed information about most of the
Kubernetes primitives, including Nodes, Pods, and Deployments. The describe output is
designed to be human readable, not to be scripted against.</div><h3 id="show-the-app-in-the-terminal">Show the app in the terminal</h3><p>Recall that Pods are running in an isolated, private network - so we need to proxy access
to them so we can debug and interact with them. To do this, we'll use the <code>kubectl proxy</code>
command to run a proxy in a <strong>second terminal</strong>. Open a new terminal window, and
in that new terminal, run:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex"><span>kubectl proxy
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now again, we'll get the Pod name and query that pod directly through the proxy.
To get the Pod name and store it in the <code>POD_NAME</code> environment variable:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex"><span><span style="color:#a2f">export</span> <span style="color:#b8860b">POD_NAME</span><span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#b44">"</span><span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:700">$(</span>kubectl get pods -o go-template --template <span style="color:#b44">'{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'</span><span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:700">)</span><span style="color:#b44">"</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex"><span><span style="color:#a2f">echo</span> Name of the Pod: <span style="color:#b8860b">$POD_NAME</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To see the output of our application, run a <code>curl</code> request:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex"><span>curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/<span style="color:#b8860b">$POD_NAME</span>:8080/proxy/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The URL is the route to the API of the Pod.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>We don't need to specify the container name, because we only have one container inside the pod.</div><h3 id="executing-commands-on-the-container">Executing commands on the container</h3><p>We can execute commands directly on the container once the Pod is up and running.
For this, we use the <code>exec</code> subcommand and use the name of the Pod as a parameter.
Let’s list the environment variables:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex"><span>kubectl <span style="color:#a2f">exec</span> <span style="color:#b44">"</span><span style="color:#b8860b">$POD_NAME</span><span style="color:#b44">"</span> -- env
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Again, it's worth mentioning that the name of the container itself can be omitted
since we only have a single container in the Pod.</p><p>Next let’s start a bash session in the Pod’s container:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex"><span>kubectl <span style="color:#a2f">exec</span> -ti <span style="color:#b8860b">$POD_NAME</span> -- bash
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We have now an open console on the container where we run our NodeJS application.
The source code of the app is in the <code>server.js</code> file:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex"><span>cat server.js
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can check that the application is up by running a curl command:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex"><span>curl http://localhost:8080
</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>Here we used <code>localhost</code> because we executed the command inside the NodeJS Pod.
If you cannot connect to <code>localhost:8080</code>, check to make sure you have run the
<code>kubectl exec</code> command and are launching the command from within the Pod.</div><p>To close your container connection, type <code>exit</code>.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next</h2><ul><li>Tutorial
