A good name should be descriptive of the associated expression. Name must be a qualified name consisting of alphanumeric characters, '-', '<em>' or '.', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. 'MyName', or 'my.name', or '123-abc', regex used for validation is '([A-Za-z0-9][-A-Za-z0-9</em>.]*)?[A-Za-z0-9]') with an optional DNS subdomain prefix and '/' (e.g. 'example.com/MyName')</p><p>Required.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>webhooks.matchPolicy</strong> (string)</p><p>matchPolicy defines how the "rules" list is used to match incoming requests. Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent".</p><ul><li><p>Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only included <code>apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]</code>, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the webhook.</p></li><li><p>Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included <code>apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]</code>, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the webhook.</p></li></ul><p>Defaults to "Equivalent"</p><p>Possible enum values:</p><ul><li><code>"Equivalent"</code> means requests should be sent to the webhook if they modify a resource listed in rules via another API group or version.</li><li><code>"Exact"</code> means requests should only be sent to the webhook if they exactly match a given rule.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>webhooks.namespaceSelector</strong> (<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/label-selector/#LabelSelector">LabelSelector</a>)</p><p>NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the webhook on an object based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the webhook.</p><p>For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {
"matchExpressions": [
{
"key": "runlevel",
"operator": "NotIn",
"values": [
"0",
"1"
]
}
]
}</p><p>If instead you want to only run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {
"matchExpressions": [
{
"key": "environment",
"operator": "In",
"values": [
"prod",
"staging"
]
}
]
}</p><p>See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/">https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/</a> for more examples of label selectors.</p><p>Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.</p></li><li><p><strong>webhooks.objectSelector</strong> (<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/label-selector/#LabelSelector">LabelSelector</a>)</p><p>ObjectSelector decides whether to run the webhook based on if the object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both the oldObject and newObject that would be sent to the webhook, and is considered to match if either object matches the selector. A null object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object that cannot have labels (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels. Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.</p></li><li><p><strong>webhooks.reinvocationPolicy</strong> (string)</p><p>reinvocationPolicy indicates whether this webhook should be called multiple times as part of a single admission evaluation. Allowed values are "Never" and "IfNeeded".</p><p>Never: the webhook will not be called more than once in a single admission evaluation.</p><p>IfNeeded: the webhook will be called at least one additional time as part of the admission evaluation if the object being admitted is modified by other admission plugins after the initial webhook call. Webhooks that specify this option <em>must</em> be idempotent, able to process objects they previously admitted. Note: * the number of additional invocations is not guaranteed to be exactly one. * if additional invocations result in further modifications to the object, webhooks are not guaranteed to be invoked again. * webhooks that use this option may be reordered to minimize the number of additional invocations. * to validate an object after all mutations are guaranteed complete, use a validating admission webhook instead.</p><p>Defaults to "Never".</p></li><li><p><strong>webhooks.rules</strong> ([]RuleWithOperations)</p><p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p><p>Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook cares about. The webhook cares about an operation if it matches <em>any</em> Rule. However, in order to prevent ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks from putting the cluster in a state which cannot be recovered from without completely disabling the plugin, ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are never called on admission requests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects.</p><p><a name="RuleWithOperations"/><em>RuleWithOperations is a tuple of Operations and Resources.

'<em>' is all groups. If '</em>' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.</p></li><li><p><strong>webhooks.rules.apiVersions</strong> ([]string)</p><p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p><p>APIVersions is the API versions the resources belong to. '<em>' is all versions. If '</em>' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.</p></li><li><p><strong>webhooks.rules.operations</strong> ([]string)</p><p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p><p>Operations is the operations the admission hook cares about - CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, CONNECT or * for all of those operations and any future admission operations that are added. If '*' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.</p></li><li><p><strong>webhooks.rules.resources</strong> ([]string)</p><p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p><p>Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to.</p><p>For example: 'pods' means pods. 'pods/log' means the log subresource of pods. '<em>' means all resources, but not subresources. 'pods/</em>' means all subresources of pods. '<em>/scale' means all scale subresources. '</em>/*' means all resources and their subresources.</p><p>If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not overlap with each other.</p><p>Depending on the enclosing object, subresources might not be allowed. Required.</p></li><li><p><strong>webhooks.rules.scope</strong> (string)</p><p>scope specifies the scope of this rule. Valid values are "Cluster", "Namespaced", and "<em>" "Cluster" means that only cluster-scoped resources will match this rule. Namespace API objects are cluster-scoped. "Namespaced" means that only namespaced resources will match this rule. "</em>" means that there are no scope restrictions. Subresources match the scope of their parent resource. Default is "*".</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>webhooks.timeoutSeconds</strong> (int32)</p><p>TimeoutSeconds specifies the timeout for this webhook. After the timeout passes, the webhook call will be ignored or the API call will fail based on the failure policy. The timeout value must be between 1 and 30 seconds.
