The targeted devices include GPUs, high-performance NICs, FPGAs, InfiniBand adapters,
and other similar computing resources that may require vendor specific initialization
and setup.</p><h2 id="device-plugin-registration">Device plugin registration</h2><p>The kubelet exports a <code>Registration</code> gRPC service:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-gRPC" data-lang="gRPC">service Registration {
	rpc Register(RegisterRequest) returns (Empty) {}
}
</code></pre><p>A device plugin can register itself with the kubelet through this gRPC service.
During the registration, the device plugin needs to send:</p><ul><li>The name of its Unix socket.</li><li>The Device Plugin API version against which it was built.</li><li>The <code>ResourceName</code> it wants to advertise. Here <code>ResourceName</code> needs to follow the
<a href="/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#extended-resources">extended resource naming scheme</a>
as <code>vendor-domain/resourcetype</code>.
(For example, an NVIDIA GPU is advertised as <code>nvidia.com/gpu</code>.)</li></ul><p>Following a successful registration, the device plugin sends the kubelet the
list of devices it manages, and the kubelet is then in charge of advertising those
resources to the API server as part of the kubelet node status update.
For example, after a device plugin registers <code>hardware-vendor.example/foo</code> with the kubelet
and reports two healthy devices on a node, the node status is updated
to advertise that the node has 2 "Foo" devices installed and available.</p><p>Then, users can request devices as part of a Pod specification
(see <a href="/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#Container"><code>container</code></a>).
Requesting extended resources is similar to how you manage requests and limits for
other resources, with the following differences:</p><ul><li>Extended resources are only supported as integer resources and cannot be overcommitted.</li><li>Devices cannot be shared between containers.</li></ul><h3 id="example-pod">Example</h3><p>Suppose a Kubernetes cluster is running a device plugin that advertises resource <code>hardware-vendor.example/foo</code>

path <code>/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/kubelet.sock</code>.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>The ordering of the workflow is important. A plugin MUST start serving gRPC
service before registering itself with kubelet for successful registration.</div></li><li><p>After successfully registering itself, the device plugin runs in serving mode, during which it keeps
monitoring device health and reports back to the kubelet upon any device state changes.
It is also responsible for serving <code>Allocate</code> gRPC requests. During <code>Allocate</code>, the device plugin may
do device-specific preparation; for example, GPU cleanup or QRNG initialization.
If the operations succeed, the device plugin returns an <code>AllocateResponse</code> that contains container
runtime configurations for accessing the allocated devices. The kubelet passes this information
to the container runtime.</p><p>An <code>AllocateResponse</code> contains zero or more <code>ContainerAllocateResponse</code> objects. In these, the
device plugin defines modifications that must be made to a container's definition to provide
access to the device. These modifications include:</p><ul><li><a href="/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/">Annotations</a></li><li>device nodes</li><li>environment variables</li><li>mounts</li><li>fully-qualified CDI device names</li></ul><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>The processing of the fully-qualified CDI device names by the Device Manager requires

v1.28, graduated to beta in v1.29 and to GA in v1.31.</div></li></ol><h3 id="handling-kubelet-restarts">Handling kubelet restarts</h3><p>A device plugin is expected to detect kubelet restarts and re-register itself with the new
kubelet instance. A new kubelet instance deletes all the existing Unix sockets under
<code>/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins</code> when it starts. A device plugin can monitor the deletion
of its Unix socket and re-register itself upon such an event.</p><h3 id="device-plugin-and-unhealthy-devices">Device plugin and unhealthy devices</h3><p>There are cases when devices fail or are shut down. The responsibility of the Device Plugin
in this case is to notify the kubelet about the situation using the <code>ListAndWatchResponse</code> API.</p><p>Once a device is marked as unhealthy, the kubelet will decrease the allocatable count
for this resource on the Node to reflect how many devices can be used for scheduling new pods.
Capacity count for the resource will not change.</p><p>Pods that were assigned to the failed devices will continue be assigned to this device.
It is typical that code relying on the device will start failing and Pod may get
into Failed phase if <code>restartPolicy</code> for the Pod was not <code>Always</code> or enter the crash loop
otherwise.</p><p>Before Kubernetes v1.31, the way to know whether or not a Pod is associated with the
failed device is to use the <a href="#monitoring-device-plugin-resources">PodResources API</a>.</p><div class="feature-state-notice feature-alpha" title="Feature Gate: ResourceHealthStatus"><span class="feature-state-name">FEATURE STATE:</span>
<code>Kubernetes v1.31 [alpha]</code> (enabled by default: false)</div><p>By enabling the feature gate <code>ResourceHealthStatus</code>, the field <code>allocatedResourcesStatus</code>
will be added to each container status, within the <code>.status</code> for each Pod. The <code>allocatedResourcesStatus</code>
field
reports health information for each device assigned to the container.</p><p>For a failed Pod, or where you suspect a fault, you can use this status to understand whether
the Pod behavior may be associated with device failure. For example, if an accelerator is reporting
an over-temperature event, the <code>allocatedResourcesStatus</code> field may be able to report this.</p><h2 id="device-plugin-deployment">Device plugin deployment</h2><p>You can deploy a device plugin as a DaemonSet, as a package for your node's operating system,
or manually.</p><p>The canonical directory <code>/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins</code> requires privileged access,
so a device plugin must run in a privileged security context.
If you're deploying a device plugin as a DaemonSet, <code>/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins</code>

Pod onto Nodes, to restart the daemon Pod after failure, and to help automate upgrades.</p><h2 id="api-compatibility">API compatibility</h2><p>Previously, the versioning scheme required the Device Plugin's API version to match
exactly the Kubelet's version. Since the graduation of this feature to Beta in v1.12
this is no longer a hard requirement. The API is versioned and has been stable since
Beta graduation of this feature. Because of this, kubelet upgrades should be seamless
but there still may be changes in the API before stabilization making upgrades not
guaranteed to be non-breaking.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>Although the Device Manager component of Kubernetes is a generally available feature,
