<code>Kubernetes v1.29 [stable]</code></div><p>Controlling the behavior of the Kubernetes API server in an overload situation
is a key task for cluster administrators. The <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="Control plane component that serves the Kubernetes API." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="/docs/concepts/architecture/#kube-apiserver" target="_blank" aria-label="kube-apiserver">kube-apiserver</a> has some controls available
(i.e. the <code>--max-requests-inflight</code> and <code>--max-mutating-requests-inflight</code>
command-line flags) to limit the amount of outstanding work that will be
accepted, preventing a flood of inbound requests from overloading and
potentially crashing the API server, but these flags are not enough to ensure
that the most important requests get through in a period of high traffic.</p><p>The API Priority and Fairness feature (APF) is an alternative that improves upon
aforementioned max-inflight limitations. APF classifies
and isolates requests in a more fine-grained way. It also introduces
a limited amount of queuing, so that no requests are rejected in cases
of very brief bursts. Requests are dispatched from queues using a
fair queuing technique so that, for example, a poorly-behaved

starve others (even at the same priority level).</p><p>This feature is designed to work well with standard controllers, which
use informers and react to failures of API requests with exponential
back-off, and other clients that also work this way.</p><div class="alert alert-caution" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Caution:</h4>Some requests classified as "long-running"—such as remote
command execution or log tailing—are not subject to the API
Priority and Fairness filter. This is also true for the
<code>--max-requests-inflight</code> flag without the API Priority and Fairness
feature enabled. API Priority and Fairness <em>does</em> apply to <strong>watch</strong>
requests. When API Priority and Fairness is disabled, <strong>watch</strong> requests
are not subject to the <code>--max-requests-inflight</code> limit.</div><h2 id="enabling-disabling-api-priority-and-fairness">Enabling/Disabling API Priority and Fairness</h2><p>The API Priority and Fairness feature is controlled by a command-line flag

options and how to enable and disable them. The name of the

API Priority and Fairness feature.</p><h2 id="recursive-server-scenarios">Recursive server scenarios</h2><p>API Priority and Fairness must be used carefully in recursive server
scenarios. These are scenarios in which some server A, while serving
a request, issues a subsidiary request to some server B. Perhaps
server B might even make a further subsidiary call back to server
A. In situations where Priority and Fairness control is applied to
both the original request and some subsidiary ones(s), no matter how
deep in the recursion, there is a danger of priority inversions and/or
deadlocks.</p><p>One example of recursion is when the <code>kube-apiserver</code> issues an
admission webhook call to server B, and while serving that call,
server B makes a further subsidiary request back to the
<code>kube-apiserver</code>. Another example of recursion is when an <code>APIService</code>
object directs the <code>kube-apiserver</code> to delegate requests about a
certain API group to a custom external server B (this is one of the
things called "aggregation").</p><p>When the original request is known to belong to a certain priority
level, and the subsidiary controlled requests are classified to higher
priority levels, this is one possible solution. When the original
requests can belong to any priority level, the subsidiary controlled
requests have to be exempt from Priority and Fairness limitation. One
way to do that is with the objects that configure classification and
handling, discussed below. Another way is to disable Priority and
Fairness on server B entirely, using the techniques discussed above. A
third way, which is the simplest to use when server B is not
<code>kube-apiserver</code>, is to build server B with Priority and Fairness
disabled in the code.</p><h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2><p>There are several distinct features involved in the API Priority and Fairness
feature. Incoming requests are classified by attributes of the request using
<em>FlowSchemas</em>, and assigned to priority levels. Priority levels add a degree of
isolation by maintaining separate concurrency limits, so that requests assigned
to different priority levels cannot starve each other. Within a priority level,
a fair-queuing algorithm prevents requests from different <em>flows</em> from starving
each other, and allows for requests to be queued to prevent bursty traffic from
causing failed requests when the average load is acceptably low.</p><h3 id="priority-levels">Priority Levels</h3><p>Without APF enabled, overall concurrency in the API server is limited by the
<code>kube-apiserver</code> flags <code>--max-requests-inflight</code> and
<code>--max-mutating-requests-inflight</code>. With APF enabled, the concurrency limits
defined by these flags are summed and then the sum is divided up among a
configurable set of <em>priority levels</em>. Each incoming request is assigned to a
single priority level, and each priority level will only dispatch as many
concurrent requests as its particular limit allows.</p><p>The default configuration, for example, includes separate priority levels for
leader-election requests, requests from built-in controllers, and requests from
Pods. This means that an ill-behaved Pod that floods the API server with
requests cannot prevent leader election or actions by the built-in controllers
from succeeding.</p><p>The concurrency limits of the priority levels are periodically
adjusted, allowing under-utilized priority levels to temporarily lend
concurrency to heavily-utilized levels. These limits are based on
nominal limits and bounds on how much concurrency a priority level may
lend and how much it may borrow, all derived from the configuration
objects mentioned below.</p><h3 id="seats-occupied-by-a-request">Seats Occupied by a Request</h3><p>The above description of concurrency management is the baseline story.
Requests have different durations but are counted equally at any given
moment when comparing against a priority level's concurrency limit. In
the baseline story, each request occupies one unit of concurrency. The
word "seat" is used to mean one unit of concurrency, inspired by the
way each passenger on a train or aircraft takes up one of the fixed
supply of seats.</p><p>But some requests take up more than one seat. Some of these are <strong>list</strong>
requests that the server estimates will return a large number of
objects. These have been found to put an exceptionally heavy burden
on the server. For this reason, the server estimates the number of objects
that will be returned and considers the request to take a number of seats
that is proportional to that estimated number.</p><h3 id="execution-time-tweaks-for-watch-requests">Execution time tweaks for watch requests</h3><p>API Priority and Fairness manages <strong>watch</strong> requests, but this involves a
couple more excursions from the baseline behavior. The first concerns
how long a <strong>watch</strong> request is considered to occupy its seat. Depending
on request parameters, the response to a <strong>watch</strong> request may or may not
begin with <strong>create</strong> notifications for all the relevant pre-existing
objects. API Priority and Fairness considers a <strong>watch</strong> request to be
done with its seat once that initial burst of notifications, if any,
is over.</p><p>The normal notifications are sent in a concurrent burst to all
relevant <strong>watch</strong> response streams whenever the server is notified of an
object create/update/delete. To account for this work, API Priority
and Fairness considers every write request to spend some additional
time occupying seats after the actual writing is done. The server
estimates the number of notifications to be sent and adjusts the write
request's number of seats and seat occupancy time to include this
extra work.</p><h3 id="queuing">Queuing</h3><p>Even within a priority level there may be a large number of distinct sources of
traffic. In an overload situation, it is valuable to prevent one stream of
requests from starving others (in particular, in the relatively common case of a
single buggy client flooding the kube-apiserver with requests, that buggy client
would ideally not have much measurable impact on other clients at all). This is
handled by use of a fair-queuing algorithm to process requests that are assigned
the same priority level. Each request is assigned to a <em>flow</em>, identified by the
name of the matching FlowSchema plus a <em>flow distinguisher</em> — which
is either the requesting user, the target resource's namespace, or nothing — and the
system attempts to give approximately equal weight to requests in different
flows of the same priority level.
To enable distinct handling of distinct instances, controllers that have
many instances should authenticate with distinct usernames</p><p>After classifying a request into a flow, the API Priority and Fairness
feature then may assign the request to a queue. This assignment uses
a technique known as <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A technique for assigning requests to queues that provides better isolation than hashing modulo the number of queues." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-shuffle-sharding" target="_blank" aria-label="shuffle sharding">shuffle sharding</a>, which makes relatively efficient use of
queues to insulate low-intensity flows from high-intensity flows.</p><p>The details of the queuing algorithm are tunable for each priority level, and
allow administrators to trade off memory use, fairness (the property that
independent flows will all make progress when total traffic exceeds capacity),
tolerance for bursty traffic, and the added latency induced by queuing.</p><h3 id="exempt-requests">Exempt requests</h3><p>Some requests are considered sufficiently important that they are not subject to
any of the limitations imposed by this feature. These exemptions prevent an
improperly-configured flow control configuration from totally disabling an API
server.</p><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>The flow control API involves two kinds of resources.
<a href="/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.34/#prioritylevelconfiguration-v1-flowcontrol-apiserver-k8s-io">PriorityLevelConfigurations</a>
define the available priority levels, the share of the available concurrency
budget that each can handle, and allow for fine-tuning queuing behavior.
<a href="/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.34/#flowschema-v1-flowcontrol-apiserver-k8s-io">FlowSchemas</a>
are used to classify individual inbound requests, matching each to a
single PriorityLevelConfiguration.</p><h3 id="prioritylevelconfiguration">PriorityLevelConfiguration</h3><p>A PriorityLevelConfiguration represents a single priority level. Each
PriorityLevelConfiguration has an independent limit on the number of outstanding
requests, and limitations on the number of queued requests.</p><p>The nominal concurrency limit for a PriorityLevelConfiguration is not
specified in an absolute number of seats, but rather in "nominal
concurrency shares." The total concurrency limit for the API Server is
distributed among the existing PriorityLevelConfigurations in
proportion to these shares, to give each level its nominal limit in
terms of seats. This allows a cluster administrator to scale up or
down the total amount of traffic to a server by restarting
<code>kube-apiserver</code> with a different value for <code>--max-requests-inflight</code>
(or <code>--max-mutating-requests-inflight</code>), and all
PriorityLevelConfigurations will see their maximum allowed concurrency
go up (or down) by the same fraction.</p><div class="alert alert-caution" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Caution:</h4>In the versions before <code>v1beta3</code> the relevant
PriorityLevelConfiguration field is named "assured concurrency shares"
rather than "nominal concurrency shares". Also, in Kubernetes release
1.25 and earlier there were no periodic adjustments: the
nominal/assured limits were always applied without adjustment.</div><p>The bounds on how much concurrency a priority level may lend and how
much it may borrow are expressed in the PriorityLevelConfiguration as
percentages of the level's nominal limit. These are resolved to
absolute numbers of seats by multiplying with the nominal limit /
100.0 and rounding. The dynamically adjusted concurrency limit of a
priority level is constrained to lie between (a) a lower bound of its
nominal limit minus its lendable seats and (b) an upper bound of its
nominal limit plus the seats it may borrow. At each adjustment the
dynamic limits are derived by each priority level reclaiming any lent
seats for which demand recently appeared and then jointly fairly
responding to the recent seat demand on the priority levels, within
the bounds just described.</p><div class="alert alert-caution" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Caution:</h4>With the Priority and Fairness feature enabled, the total concurrency limit for
the server is set to the sum of <code>--max-requests-inflight</code> and
<code>--max-mutating-requests-inflight</code>. There is no longer any distinction made
between mutating and non-mutating requests; if you want to treat them
separately for a given resource, make separate FlowSchemas that match the
mutating and non-mutating verbs respectively.</div><p>When the volume of inbound requests assigned to a single
PriorityLevelConfiguration is more than its permitted concurrency level, the
<code>type</code> field of its specification determines what will happen to extra requests.
A type of <code>Reject</code> means that excess traffic will immediately be rejected with
an HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) error. A type of <code>Queue</code> means that requests
above the threshold will be queued, with the shuffle sharding and fair queuing techniques used
to balance progress between request flows.</p><p>The queuing configuration allows tuning the fair queuing algorithm for a
priority level. Details of the algorithm can be read in the
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/1040-priority-and-fairness">enhancement proposal</a>, but in short:</p><ul><li><p>Increasing <code>queues</code> reduces the rate of collisions between different flows, at
the cost of increased memory usage. A value of 1 here effectively disables the
fair-queuing logic, but still allows requests to be queued.</p></li><li><p>Increasing <code>queueLengthLimit</code> allows larger bursts of traffic to be
sustained without dropping any requests, at the cost of increased
latency and memory usage.</p></li><li><p>Changing <code>handSize</code> allows you to adjust the probability of collisions between
different flows and the overall concurrency available to a single flow in an
overload situation.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>A larger <code>handSize</code> makes it less likely for two individual flows to collide
(and therefore for one to be able to starve the other), but more likely that
a small number of flows can dominate the apiserver. A larger <code>handSize</code> also
potentially increases the amount of latency that a single high-traffic flow
can cause. The maximum number of queued requests possible from a
single flow is <code>handSize * queueLengthLimit</code>.</div></li></ul><p>Following is a table showing an interesting collection of shuffle
sharding configurations, showing for each the probability that a
given mouse (low-intensity flow) is squished by the elephants (high-intensity flows) for

priority level. Every inbound request is tested against FlowSchemas,
starting with those with the numerically lowest <code>matchingPrecedence</code> and
working upward. The first match wins.</p><div class="alert alert-caution" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Caution:</h4>Only the first matching FlowSchema for a given request matters. If multiple
FlowSchemas match a single inbound request, it will be assigned based on the one
with the highest <code>matchingPrecedence</code>. If multiple FlowSchemas with equal
<code>matchingPrecedence</code> match the same request, the one with lexicographically
smaller <code>name</code> will win, but it's better not to rely on this, and instead to
ensure that no two FlowSchemas have the same <code>matchingPrecedence</code>.</div><p>A FlowSchema matches a given request if at least one of its <code>rules</code>
matches. A rule matches if at least one of its <code>subjects</code> <em>and</em> at least
one of its <code>resourceRules</code> or <code>nonResourceRules</code> (depending on whether the
incoming request is for a resource or non-resource URL) match the request.</p><p>For the <code>name</code> field in subjects, and the <code>verbs</code>, <code>apiGroups</code>, <code>resources</code>,
<code>namespaces</code>, and <code>nonResourceURLs</code> fields of resource and non-resource rules,
the wildcard <code>*</code> may be specified to match all values for the given field,
effectively removing it from consideration.</p><p>A FlowSchema's <code>distinguisherMethod.type</code> determines how requests matching that
schema will be separated into flows. It may be <code>ByUser</code>, in which one requesting
user will not be able to starve other users of capacity; <code>ByNamespace</code>, in which
requests for resources in one namespace will not be able to starve requests for
resources in other namespaces of capacity; or blank (or <code>distinguisherMethod</code> may be
omitted entirely), in which all requests matched by this FlowSchema will be
considered part of a single flow. The correct choice for a given FlowSchema
depends on the resource and your particular environment.</p><h2 id="defaults">Defaults</h2><p>Each kube-apiserver maintains two sorts of APF configuration objects:
mandatory and suggested.</p><h3 id="mandatory-configuration-objects">Mandatory Configuration Objects</h3><p>The four mandatory configuration objects reflect fixed built-in
guardrail behavior. This is behavior that the servers have before
those objects exist, and when those objects exist their specs reflect
this behavior. The four mandatory objects are as follows.</p><ul><li><p>The mandatory <code>exempt</code> priority level is used for requests that are
not subject to flow control at all: they will always be dispatched
immediately. The mandatory <code>exempt</code> FlowSchema classifies all
requests from the <code>system:masters</code> group into this priority
level. You may define other FlowSchemas that direct other requests
to this priority level, if appropriate.</p></li><li><p>The mandatory <code>catch-all</code> priority level is used in combination with
the mandatory <code>catch-all</code> FlowSchema to make sure that every request
gets some kind of classification. Typically you should not rely on
this catch-all configuration, and should create your own catch-all
FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration (or use the suggested
<code>global-default</code> priority level that is installed by default) as
appropriate. Because it is not expected to be used normally, the
mandatory <code>catch-all</code> priority level has a very small concurrency
share and does not queue requests.</p></li></ul><h3 id="suggested-configuration-objects">Suggested Configuration Objects</h3><p>The suggested FlowSchemas and PriorityLevelConfigurations constitute a
reasonable default configuration. You can modify these and/or create
additional configuration objects if you want. If your cluster is
likely to experience heavy load then you should consider what
configuration will work best.</p><p>The suggested configuration groups requests into six priority levels:</p><ul><li><p>The <code>node-high</code> priority level is for health updates from nodes.</p></li><li><p>The <code>system</code> priority level is for non-health requests from the
<code>system:nodes</code> group, i.e. Kubelets, which must be able to contact
the API server in order for workloads to be able to schedule on
them.</p></li><li><p>The <code>leader-election</code> priority level is for leader election requests from
built-in controllers (in particular, requests for <code>endpoints</code>, <code>configmaps</code>,
or <code>leases</code> coming from the <code>system:kube-controller-manager</code> or
<code>system:kube-scheduler</code> users and service accounts in the <code>kube-system</code>
namespace). These are important to isolate from other traffic because failures
in leader election cause their controllers to fail and restart, which in turn
causes more expensive traffic as the new controllers sync their informers.</p></li><li><p>The <code>workload-high</code> priority level is for other requests from built-in
controllers.</p></li><li><p>The <code>workload-low</code> priority level is for requests from any other service
account, which will typically include all requests from controllers running in
Pods.</p></li><li><p>The <code>global-default</code> priority level handles all other traffic, e.g.
interactive <code>kubectl</code> commands run by nonprivileged users.</p></li></ul><p>The suggested FlowSchemas serve to steer requests into the above
priority levels, and are not enumerated here.</p><h3 id="maintenance-of-the-mandatory-and-suggested-configuration-objects">Maintenance of the Mandatory and Suggested Configuration Objects</h3><p>Each <code>kube-apiserver</code> independently maintains the mandatory and
suggested configuration objects, using initial and periodic behavior.
Thus, in a situation with a mixture of servers of different versions
there may be thrashing as long as different servers have different
opinions of the proper content of these objects.</p><p>Each <code>kube-apiserver</code> makes an initial maintenance pass over the
mandatory and suggested configuration objects, and after that does
periodic maintenance (once per minute) of those objects.</p><p>For the mandatory configuration objects, maintenance consists of
ensuring that the object exists and, if it does, has the proper spec.
The server refuses to allow a creation or update with a spec that is
inconsistent with the server's guardrail behavior.</p><p>Maintenance of suggested configuration objects is designed to allow
their specs to be overridden. Deletion, on the other hand, is not
respected: maintenance will restore the object. If you do not want a
suggested configuration object then you need to keep it around but set
its spec to have minimal consequences. Maintenance of suggested
objects is also designed to support automatic migration when a new
version of the <code>kube-apiserver</code> is rolled out, albeit potentially with
thrashing while there is a mixed population of servers.</p><p>Maintenance of a suggested configuration object consists of creating
it --- with the server's suggested spec --- if the object does not
exist. OTOH, if the object already exists, maintenance behavior
depends on whether the <code>kube-apiservers</code> or the users control the
object. In the former case, the server ensures that the object's spec
is what the server suggests; in the latter case, the spec is left
alone.</p><p>The question of who controls the object is answered by first looking
for an annotation with key <code>apf.kubernetes.io/autoupdate-spec</code>. If
there is such an annotation and its value is <code>true</code> then the
kube-apiservers control the object. If there is such an annotation
and its value is <code>false</code> then the users control the object. If
neither of those conditions holds then the <code>metadata.generation</code> of the
object is consulted. If that is 1 then the kube-apiservers control
the object. Otherwise the users control the object. These rules were
introduced in release 1.22 and their consideration of
<code>metadata.generation</code> is for the sake of migration from the simpler
earlier behavior. Users who wish to control a suggested configuration
object should set its <code>apf.kubernetes.io/autoupdate-spec</code> annotation
to <code>false</code>.</p><p>Maintenance of a mandatory or suggested configuration object also
includes ensuring that it has an <code>apf.kubernetes.io/autoupdate-spec</code>
annotation that accurately reflects whether the kube-apiservers
control the object.</p><p>Maintenance also includes deleting objects that are neither mandatory
nor suggested but are annotated
<code>apf.kubernetes.io/autoupdate-spec=true</code>.</p><h2 id="health-check-concurrency-exemption">Health check concurrency exemption</h2><p>The suggested configuration gives no special treatment to the health
check requests on kube-apiservers from their local kubelets --- which
tend to use the secured port but supply no credentials. With the
suggested config, these requests get assigned to the <code>global-default</code>
FlowSchema and the corresponding <code>global-default</code> priority level,
where other traffic can crowd them out.</p><p>If you add the following additional FlowSchema, this exempts those
requests from rate limiting.</p><div class="alert alert-caution" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Caution:</h4>Making this change also allows any hostile party to then send
health-check requests that match this FlowSchema, at any volume they
like. If you have a web traffic filter or similar external security
mechanism to protect your cluster's API server from general internet
traffic, you can configure rules to block any health check requests
that originate from outside your cluster.</div><div class="highlight code-sample"><div class="copy-code-icon"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/priority-and-fairness/health-for-strangers.yaml" download="priority-and-fairness/health-for-strangers.yaml"><code>priority-and-fairness/health-for-strangers.yaml</code>

experience increased latency or be dropped with an HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
error. To prevent these side effects of APF, you can modify your workload or
tweak your APF settings to ensure there are sufficient seats available to serve
your requests.</p><p>To detect whether requests are being rejected due to APF, check the following
metrics:</p><ul><li>apiserver_flowcontrol_rejected_requests_total: the total number of requests
rejected per FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration.</li><li>apiserver_flowcontrol_current_inqueue_requests: the current number of requests
queued per FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration.</li><li>apiserver_flowcontrol_request_wait_duration_seconds: the latency added to
requests waiting in queues.</li><li>apiserver_flowcontrol_priority_level_seat_utilization: the seat utilization
per PriorityLevelConfiguration.</li></ul><h3 id="good-practice-workload-modifications">Workload modifications</h3><p>To prevent requests from queuing and adding latency or being dropped due to APF,
you can optimize your requests by:</p><ul><li>Reducing the rate at which requests are executed. A fewer number of requests
over a fixed period will result in a fewer number of seats being needed at a
given time.</li><li>Avoid issuing a large number of expensive requests concurrently. Requests can
be optimized to use fewer seats or have lower latency so that these requests
hold those seats for a shorter duration. List requests can occupy more than 1
seat depending on the number of objects fetched during the request. Restricting
the number of objects retrieved in a list request, for example by using
pagination, will use less total seats over a shorter period. Furthermore,
replacing list requests with watch requests will require lower total concurrency
shares as watch requests only occupy 1 seat during its initial burst of
notifications. If using streaming lists in versions 1.27 and later, watch
requests will occupy the same number of seats as a list request for its initial
burst of notifications because the entire state of the collection has to be
streamed. Note that in both cases, a watch request will not hold any seats after
this initial phase.</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that queuing or rejected requests from APF could be induced by
either an increase in the number of requests or an increase in latency for
existing requests. For example, if requests that normally take 1s to execute
start taking 60s, it is possible that APF will start rejecting requests because
requests are occupying seats for a longer duration than normal due to this
increase in latency. If APF starts rejecting requests across multiple priority
levels without a significant change in workload, it is possible there is an
underlying issue with control plane performance rather than the workload or APF
settings.</p><h3 id="good-practice-apf-settings">Priority and fairness settings</h3><p>You can also modify the default FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration
objects or create new objects of these types to better accommodate your
workload.</p><p>APF settings can be modified to:</p><ul><li>Give more seats to high priority requests.</li><li>Isolate non-essential or expensive requests that would starve a concurrency
level if it was shared with other flows.</li></ul><h4 id="give-more-seats-to-high-priority-requests">Give more seats to high priority requests</h4><ol><li>If possible, the number of seats available across all priority levels for a
particular <code>kube-apiserver</code> can be increased by increasing the values for the
<code>max-requests-inflight</code> and <code>max-mutating-requests-inflight</code> flags. Alternatively,
horizontally scaling the number of <code>kube-apiserver</code> instances will increase the
total concurrency per priority level across the cluster assuming there is
sufficient load balancing of requests.</li><li>You can create a new FlowSchema which references a PriorityLevelConfiguration
with a larger concurrency level. This new PriorityLevelConfiguration could be an
existing level or a new level with its own set of nominal concurrency shares.
For example, a new FlowSchema could be introduced to change the
PriorityLevelConfiguration for your requests from global-default to workload-low
to increase the number of seats available to your user. Creating a new
PriorityLevelConfiguration will reduce the number of seats designated for
existing levels. Recall that editing a default FlowSchema or
PriorityLevelConfiguration will require setting the
<code>apf.kubernetes.io/autoupdate-spec</code> annotation to false.</li><li>You can also increase the NominalConcurrencyShares for the
PriorityLevelConfiguration which is serving your high priority requests.
Alternatively, for versions 1.26 and later, you can increase the LendablePercent
for competing priority levels so that the given priority level has a higher pool
of seats it can borrow.</li></ol><h4 id="isolate-non-essential-requests-from-starving-other-flows">Isolate non-essential requests from starving other flows</h4><p>For request isolation, you can create a FlowSchema whose subject matches the
user making these requests or create a FlowSchema that matches what the request
is (corresponding to the resourceRules). Next, you can map this FlowSchema to a
PriorityLevelConfiguration with a low share of seats.</p><p>For example, suppose list event requests from Pods running in the default namespace
are using 10 seats each and execute for 1 minute. To prevent these expensive
requests from impacting requests from other Pods using the existing service-accounts
FlowSchema, you can apply the following FlowSchema to isolate these list calls
from other requests.</p><p>Example FlowSchema object to isolate list event requests:</p><div class="highlight code-sample"><div class="copy-code-icon"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/priority-and-fairness/list-events-default-service-account.yaml" download="priority-and-fairness/list-events-default-service-account.yaml"><code>priority-and-fairness/list-events-default-service-account.yaml</code>
