container networking and network security with Cisco ACI.</li><li><a href="https://antrea.io/">Antrea</a> operates at Layer 3/4 to provide networking and
security services for Kubernetes, leveraging Open vSwitch as the networking
data plane. Antrea is a <a href="https://www.cncf.io/projects/antrea/">CNCF project at the Sandbox level</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/">Calico</a> is a networking and network
policy provider. Calico supports a flexible set of networking options so you
can choose the most efficient option for your situation, including non-overlay
and overlay networks, with or without BGP. Calico uses the same engine to
enforce network policy for hosts, pods, and (if using Istio &amp; Envoy)
applications at the service mesh layer.</li><li><a href="https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/getting-started/kubernetes/flannel/flannel">Canal</a>

and security solution with an eBPF-based data plane. Cilium provides a
simple flat Layer 3 network with the ability to span multiple clusters
in either a native routing or overlay/encapsulation mode, and can enforce
network policies on L3-L7 using an identity-based security model that is
decoupled from network addressing. Cilium can act as a replacement for
kube-proxy; it also offers additional, opt-in observability and security features.
Cilium is a <a href="https://www.cncf.io/projects/cilium/">CNCF project at the Graduated level</a>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/cni-genie/CNI-Genie">CNI-Genie</a> enables Kubernetes to seamlessly
