<div class="td-content"><h1 data-pagefind-weight="10">Introduction to kubectl</h1><p>kubectl is the Kubernetes cli version of a swiss army knife, and can do many things.</p><p>While this Book is focused on using kubectl to declaratively manage applications in Kubernetes, it
also covers other kubectl functions.</p><h2 id="command-families">Command Families</h2><p>Most kubectl commands typically fall into one of a few categories:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Used For</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Declarative Resource Management</td><td>Deployment and operations (e.g. GitOps)</td><td>Declaratively manage Kubernetes workloads using resource configuration</td></tr><tr><td>Imperative Resource Management</td><td>Development Only</td><td>Run commands to manage Kubernetes workloads using Command Line arguments and flags</td></tr><tr><td>Printing Workload State</td><td>Debugging</td><td>Print information about workloads</td></tr><tr><td>Interacting with Containers</td><td>Debugging</td><td>Exec, attach, cp, logs</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster Management</td><td>Cluster operations</td><td>Drain and cordon Nodes</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="declarative-application-management">Declarative Application Management</h2><p>The preferred approach for managing resources is through
declarative files called resource configuration used with the kubectl <em>Apply</em> command.
This command reads a local (or remote) file structure and modifies cluster state to
reflect the declared intent.</p><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Apply</h4>Apply is the preferred mechanism for managing resources in a Kubernetes cluster.</div><h2 id="printing-state-about-workloads">Printing State about Workloads</h2><p>Users will need to view workload state.</p><ul><li>Printing summarize state and information about resources</li><li>Printing complete state and information about resources</li><li>Printing specific fields from resources</li><li>Query resources matching labels</li></ul><h2 id="debugging-workloads">Debugging Workloads</h2><p>kubectl supports debugging by providing commands for:</p><ul><li>Printing Container logs</li><li>Printing cluster events</li><li>Exec or attaching to a Container</li><li>Copying files from Containers in the cluster to a user's filesystem</li></ul><h2 id="cluster-management">Cluster Management</h2><p>On occasion, users may need to perform operations to the Nodes of cluster. kubectl supports
commands to drain workloads from a Node so that it can be decommissioned or debugged.</p><h2 id="porcelain">Porcelain</h2><p>Users may find using resource configuration overly verbose for <em>development</em> and prefer to work with
the cluster <em>imperatively</em> with a shell-like workflow. kubectl offers porcelain commands for
generating and modifying resources.</p><ul><li>Generating + creating resources such as Deployments, StatefulSets, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.</li><li>Setting fields on resources</li><li>Editing (live) resources in a text editor</li></ul><div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Porcelain for Dev Only</h4>Porcelain commands are time saving for experimenting with workloads in a dev cluster, but shouldn't
be used for production.</div></div>
