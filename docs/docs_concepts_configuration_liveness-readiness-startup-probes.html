For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock when an application is running but unable to make progress.</p><p>If a container fails its liveness probe repeatedly, the kubelet restarts the container.</p><p>Liveness probes do not wait for readiness probes to succeed. If you want to wait before executing a liveness probe, you can either define <code>initialDelaySeconds</code> or use a

This is useful when waiting for an application to perform time-consuming initial tasks that depend on its backing services; for example: establishing network connections, loading files, and warming caches. Readiness probes can also be useful later in the container’s lifecycle, for example, when recovering from temporary faults or overloads.</p><p>If the readiness probe returns a failed state, Kubernetes removes the pod from all matching service endpoints.</p><p>Readiness probes run on the container during its whole lifecycle.</p><h2 id="startup-probe">Startup probe</h2><p>A startup probe verifies whether the application within a container is started. This can be used to adopt liveness checks on slow starting containers, avoiding them getting killed by the kubelet before they are up and running.</p><p>If such a probe is configured, it disables liveness and readiness checks until it succeeds.</p><p>This type of probe is only executed at startup, unlike liveness and readiness probes, which are run periodically.</p><ul><li>Read more about the <a href="/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes</a>.</li></ul></div>
