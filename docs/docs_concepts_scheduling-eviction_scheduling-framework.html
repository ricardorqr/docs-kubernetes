<code>Kubernetes v1.19 [stable]</code></div><p>The <em>scheduling framework</em> is a pluggable architecture for the Kubernetes scheduler.
It consists of a set of "plugin" APIs that are compiled directly into the scheduler.
These APIs allow most scheduling features to be implemented as plugins,
while keeping the scheduling "core" lightweight and maintainable. Refer to the
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/624-scheduling-framework/README.md">design proposal of the scheduling framework</a> for more technical information on
the design of the framework.</p><h2 id="framework-workflow">Framework workflow</h2><p>The Scheduling Framework defines a few extension points. Scheduler plugins
register to be invoked at one or more extension points. Some of these plugins
can change the scheduling decisions and some are informational only.</p><p>Each attempt to schedule one Pod is split into two phases, the
<strong>scheduling cycle</strong> and the <strong>binding cycle</strong>.</p><h3 id="scheduling-cycle-binding-cycle">Scheduling cycle &amp; binding cycle</h3><p>The scheduling cycle selects a node for the Pod, and the binding cycle applies
that decision to the cluster. Together, a scheduling cycle and binding cycle are
referred to as a "scheduling context".</p><p>Scheduling cycles are run serially, while binding cycles may run concurrently.</p><p>A scheduling or binding cycle can be aborted if the Pod is determined to
be unschedulable or if there is an internal error. The Pod will be returned to
the queue and retried.</p><h2 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h2><p>The following picture shows the scheduling context of a Pod and the interfaces
that the scheduling framework exposes.</p><p>One plugin may implement multiple interfaces to perform more complex or
stateful tasks.</p><p>Some interfaces match the scheduler extension points which can be configured through
<a href="/docs/reference/scheduling/config/#extension-points">Scheduler Configuration</a>.</p><figure class="diagram-large"><img src="/images/docs/scheduling-framework-extensions.png"/><figcaption><h4>Scheduling framework extension points</h4></figcaption></figure><h3 id="pre-enqueue">PreEnqueue</h3><p>These plugins are called prior to adding Pods to the internal active queue, where Pods are marked as
ready for scheduling.</p><p>Only when all PreEnqueue plugins return <code>Success</code>, the Pod is allowed to enter the active queue.
Otherwise, it's placed in the internal unschedulable Pods list, and doesn't get an <code>Unschedulable</code> condition.</p><p>For more details about how internal scheduler queues work, read
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/f03b6d5692bd979f07dd472e7b6836b2dad0fd9b/contributors/devel/sig-scheduling/scheduler_queues.md">Scheduling queue in kube-scheduler</a>.</p><h3 id="enqueueextension">EnqueueExtension</h3><p>EnqueueExtension is the interface where the plugin can control
whether to retry scheduling of Pods rejected by this plugin, based on changes in the cluster.
Plugins that implement PreEnqueue, PreFilter, Filter, Reserve or Permit should implement this interface.</p><h3 id="queueinghint">QueueingHint</h3><div class="feature-state-notice feature-stable" title="Feature Gate: SchedulerQueueingHints"><span class="feature-state-name">FEATURE STATE:</span>
<code>Kubernetes v1.34 [stable]</code> (enabled by default: true)</div><p>QueueingHint is a callback function for deciding whether a Pod can be requeued to the active queue or backoff queue.
It's executed every time a certain kind of event or change happens in the cluster.
When the QueueingHint finds that the event might make the Pod schedulable,
the Pod is put into the active queue or the backoff queue
so that the scheduler will retry the scheduling of the Pod.</p><h3 id="queue-sort">QueueSort</h3><p>These plugins are used to sort Pods in the scheduling queue. A queue sort plugin
essentially provides a <code>Less(Pod1, Pod2)</code> function. Only one queue sort
plugin may be enabled at a time.</p><h3 id="pre-filter">PreFilter</h3><p>These plugins are used to pre-process info about the Pod, or to check certain
conditions that the cluster or the Pod must meet. If a PreFilter plugin returns
an error, the scheduling cycle is aborted.</p><h3 id="filter">Filter</h3><p>These plugins are used to filter out nodes that cannot run the Pod. For each
node, the scheduler will call filter plugins in their configured order. If any
filter plugin marks the node as infeasible, the remaining plugins will not be
called for that node. Nodes may be evaluated concurrently.</p><h3 id="post-filter">PostFilter</h3><p>These plugins are called after the Filter phase, but only when no feasible nodes
were found for the pod. Plugins are called in their configured order. If
any postFilter plugin marks the node as <code>Schedulable</code>, the remaining plugins
will not be called. A typical PostFilter implementation is preemption, which
tries to make the pod schedulable by preempting other Pods.</p><h3 id="pre-score">PreScore</h3><p>These plugins are used to perform "pre-scoring" work, which generates a sharable
state for Score plugins to use. If a PreScore plugin returns an error, the
scheduling cycle is aborted.</p><h3 id="scoring">Score</h3><p>These plugins are used to rank nodes that have passed the filtering phase. The
scheduler will call each scoring plugin for each node. There will be a well
defined range of integers representing the minimum and maximum scores. After the
<a href="#normalize-scoring">NormalizeScore</a> phase, the scheduler will combine node
scores from all plugins according to the configured plugin weights.</p><h4 id="scoring-capacity">Capacity scoring</h4><div class="feature-state-notice feature-alpha" title="Feature Gate: StorageCapacityScoring"><span class="feature-state-name">FEATURE STATE:</span>
<code>Kubernetes v1.33 [alpha]</code> (enabled by default: false)</div><p>The feature gate <code>VolumeCapacityPriority</code> was used in v1.32 to support storage that are
statically provisioned. Starting from v1.33, the new feature gate <code>StorageCapacityScoring</code>
replaces the old <code>VolumeCapacityPriority</code> gate with added support to dynamically provisioned storage.
When <code>StorageCapacityScoring</code> is enabled, the VolumeBinding plugin in the kube-scheduler is extended
to score Nodes based on the storage capacity on each of them.
This feature is applicable to CSI volumes that supported <a href="/docs/concepts/storage/storage-capacity/">Storage Capacity</a>,
including local storage backed by a CSI driver.</p><h3 id="normalize-scoring">NormalizeScore</h3><p>These plugins are used to modify scores before the scheduler computes a final
ranking of Nodes. A plugin that registers for this extension point will be
called with the <a href="#scoring">Score</a> results from the same plugin. This is called
once per plugin per scheduling cycle.</p><p>For example, suppose a plugin <code>BlinkingLightScorer</code> ranks Nodes based on how
many blinking lights they have.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="display:flex"><span><span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:700">func</span> <span style="color:#00a000">ScoreNode</span>(_ <span style="color:#666">*</span>v1.pod, n <span style="color:#666">*</span>v1.Node) (<span style="color:#0b0;font-weight:700">int</span>, <span style="color:#0b0;font-weight:700">error</span>) {

<code>NodeScoreMax</code>. To fix this, <code>BlinkingLightScorer</code> should also register for this
extension point.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="display:flex"><span><span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:700">func</span> <span style="color:#00a000">NormalizeScores</span>(scores <span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:700">map</span>[<span style="color:#0b0;font-weight:700">string</span>]<span style="color:#0b0;font-weight:700">int</span>) {

aborted.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>Plugins wishing to perform "pre-reserve" work should use the
NormalizeScore extension point.</div><h3 id="reserve">Reserve</h3><p>A plugin that implements the Reserve interface has two methods, namely <code>Reserve</code>
and <code>Unreserve</code>, that back two informational scheduling phases called Reserve
and Unreserve, respectively. Plugins which maintain runtime state (aka "stateful
plugins") should use these phases to be notified by the scheduler when resources
on a node are being reserved and unreserved for a given Pod.</p><p>The Reserve phase happens before the scheduler actually binds a Pod to its
designated node. It exists to prevent race conditions while the scheduler waits
for the bind to succeed. The <code>Reserve</code> method of each Reserve plugin may succeed
or fail; if one <code>Reserve</code> method call fails, subsequent plugins are not executed
and the Reserve phase is considered to have failed. If the <code>Reserve</code> method of
all plugins succeed, the Reserve phase is considered to be successful and the
rest of the scheduling cycle and the binding cycle are executed.</p><p>The Unreserve phase is triggered if the Reserve phase or a later phase fails.
When this happens, the <code>Unreserve</code> method of <strong>all</strong> Reserve plugins will be
executed in the reverse order of <code>Reserve</code> method calls. This phase exists to
clean up the state associated with the reserved Pod.</p><div class="alert alert-caution" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Caution:</h4>The implementation of the <code>Unreserve</code> method in Reserve plugins must be
idempotent and may not fail.</div><h3 id="permit">Permit</h3><p><em>Permit</em> plugins are invoked at the end of the scheduling cycle for each Pod, to
prevent or delay the binding to the candidate node. A permit plugin can do one of
the three things:</p><ol><li><p><strong>approve</strong><br/>Once all Permit plugins approve a Pod, it is sent for binding.</p></li><li><p><strong>deny</strong><br/>If any Permit plugin denies a Pod, it is returned to the scheduling queue.
This will trigger the Unreserve phase in <a href="#reserve">Reserve plugins</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>wait</strong> (with a timeout)<br/>If a Permit plugin returns "wait", then the Pod is kept in an internal "waiting"
Pods list, and the binding cycle of this Pod starts but directly blocks until it
gets approved. If a timeout occurs, <strong>wait</strong> becomes <strong>deny</strong>
and the Pod is returned to the scheduling queue, triggering the
Unreserve phase in <a href="#reserve">Reserve plugins</a>.</p></li></ol><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>While any plugin can access the list of "waiting" Pods and approve them
(see <a href="https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-scheduling/624-scheduling-framework#frameworkhandle"><code>FrameworkHandle</code></a>),
we expect only the permit plugins to approve binding of reserved Pods that are in "waiting" state.
Once a Pod is approved, it is sent to the <a href="#pre-bind">PreBind</a> phase.</div><h3 id="pre-bind">PreBind</h3><p>These plugins are used to perform any work required before a Pod is bound. For
example, a pre-bind plugin may provision a network volume and mount it on the
target node before allowing the Pod to run there.</p><p>If any PreBind plugin returns an error, the Pod is <a href="#reserve">rejected</a> and
returned to the scheduling queue.</p><h3 id="bind">Bind</h3><p>These plugins are used to bind a Pod to a Node. Bind plugins will not be called
until all PreBind plugins have completed. Each bind plugin is called in the
configured order. A bind plugin may choose whether or not to handle the given
Pod. If a bind plugin chooses to handle a Pod, <strong>the remaining bind plugins are
skipped</strong>.</p><h3 id="post-bind">PostBind</h3><p>This is an informational interface. Post-bind plugins are called after a
Pod is successfully bound. This is the end of a binding cycle, and can be used
to clean up associated resources.</p><h2 id="plugin-api">Plugin API</h2><p>There are two steps to the plugin API. First, plugins must register and get
configured, then they use the extension point interfaces. Extension point
interfaces have the following form.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="display:flex"><span><span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:700">type</span> Plugin <span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:700">interface</span> {
