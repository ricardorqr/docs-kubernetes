<a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/" target="_blank" aria-label="Nodes">Nodes</a>. Nodes in your cluster can be <em>autoscaled</em> -
dynamically <a href="#provisioning"><em>provisioned</em></a>, or <a href="#consolidation"><em>consolidated</em></a> to provide needed
capacity while optimizing cost. Autoscaling is performed by Node <a href="#autoscalers"><em>autoscalers</em></a>.</p><h2 id="provisioning">Node provisioning</h2><p>If there are Pods in a cluster that can't be scheduled on existing Nodes, new Nodes can be
automatically added to the cluster—<em>provisioned</em>—to accommodate the Pods. This is
especially useful if the number of Pods changes over time, for example as a result of
<a href="#horizontal-workload-autoscaling">combining horizontal workload with Node autoscaling</a>.</p><p>Autoscalers provision the Nodes by creating and deleting cloud provider resources backing them. Most
commonly, the resources backing the Nodes are Virtual Machines.</p><p>The main goal of provisioning is to make all Pods schedulable. This goal is not always attainable
because of various limitations, including reaching configured provisioning limits, provisioning
configuration not being compatible with a particular set of pods, or the lack of cloud provider
capacity. While provisioning, Node autoscalers often try to achieve additional goals (for example
minimizing the cost of the provisioned Nodes or balancing the number of Nodes between failure
domains).</p><p>There are two main inputs to a Node autoscaler when determining Nodes to
provision—<a href="#provisioning-pod-constraints">Pod scheduling constraints</a>,
and <a href="#provisioning-node-constraints">Node constraints imposed by autoscaler configuration</a>.</p><p>Autoscaler configuration may also include other Node provisioning triggers (for example the number
of Nodes falling below a configured minimum limit).</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>Provisioning was formerly known as <em>scale-up</em> in Cluster Autoscaler.</div><h3 id="provisioning-pod-constraints">Pod scheduling constraints</h3><p>Pods can express <a href="/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/">scheduling constraints</a> to
impose limitations on the kind of Nodes they can be scheduled on. Node autoscalers take these
constraints into account to ensure that the pending Pods can be scheduled on the provisioned Nodes.</p><p>The most common kind of scheduling constraints are the resource requests specified by Pod
containers. Autoscalers will make sure that the provisioned Nodes have enough resources to satisfy
the requests. However, they don't directly take into account the real resource usage of the Pods
after they start running. In order to autoscale Nodes based on actual workload resource usage, you
can combine <a href="#horizontal-workload-autoscaling">horizontal workload autoscaling</a> with Node
autoscaling.</p><p>Other common Pod scheduling constraints include
<a href="/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity">Node affinity</a>,
<a href="/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity">inter-Pod affinity</a>,
or a requirement for a particular <a href="/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/">storage volume</a>.</p><h3 id="provisioning-node-constraints">Node constraints imposed by autoscaler configuration</h3><p>The specifics of the provisioned Nodes (for example the amount of resources, the presence of a given
label) depend on autoscaler configuration. Autoscalers can either choose them from a pre-defined set
of Node configurations, or use <a href="#autoprovisioning">auto-provisioning</a>.</p><h3 id="autoprovisioning">Auto-provisioning</h3><p>Node auto-provisioning is a mode of provisioning in which a user doesn't have to fully configure the
specifics of the Nodes that can be provisioned. Instead, the autoscaler dynamically chooses the Node
configuration based on the pending Pods it's reacting to, as well as pre-configured constraints (for
example, the minimum amount of resources or the need for a given label).</p><h2 id="consolidation">Node consolidation</h2><p>The main consideration when running a cluster is ensuring that all schedulable pods are running,
whilst keeping the cost of the cluster as low as possible. To achieve this, the Pods' resource
requests should utilize as much of the Nodes' resources as possible. From this perspective, the
overall Node utilization in a cluster can be used as a proxy for how cost-effective the cluster is.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>Correctly setting the resource requests of your Pods is as important to the overall
cost-effectiveness of a cluster as optimizing Node utilization.
Combining Node autoscaling with <a href="#vertical-workload-autoscaling">vertical workload autoscaling</a> can
help you achieve this.</div><p>Nodes in your cluster can be automatically <em>consolidated</em> in order to improve the overall Node
utilization, and in turn the cost-effectiveness of the cluster. Consolidation happens through
removing a set of underutilized Nodes from the cluster. Optionally, a different set of Nodes can
be <a href="#provisioning">provisioned</a> to replace them.</p><p>Consolidation, like provisioning, only considers Pod resource requests and not real resource usage
when making decisions.</p><p>For the purpose of consolidation, a Node is considered <em>empty</em> if it only has DaemonSet and static
Pods running on it. Removing empty Nodes during consolidation is more straightforward than non-empty
ones, and autoscalers often have optimizations designed specifically for consolidating empty Nodes.</p><p>Removing non-empty Nodes during consolidation is disruptive—the Pods running on them are
terminated, and possibly have to be recreated (for example by a Deployment). However, all such
recreated Pods should be able to schedule on existing Nodes in the cluster, or the replacement Nodes
provisioned as part of consolidation. <strong>No Pods should normally become pending as a result of
consolidation.</strong></p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>Autoscalers predict how a recreated Pod will likely be scheduled after a Node is provisioned or
consolidated, but they don't control the actual scheduling. Because of this, some Pods might
become pending as a result of consolidation - if for example a completely new Pod appears while
consolidation is being performed.</div><p>Autoscaler configuration may also enable triggering consolidation by other conditions (for example,
the time elapsed since a Node was created), in order to optimize different properties (for example,
the maximum lifespan of Nodes in a cluster).</p><p>The details of how consolidation is performed depend on the configuration of a given autoscaler.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>Consolidation was formerly known as <em>scale-down</em> in Cluster Autoscaler.</div><h2 id="autoscalers">Autoscalers</h2><p>The functionalities described in previous sections are provided by Node <em>autoscalers</em>. In addition
to the Kubernetes API, autoscalers also need to interact with cloud provider APIs to provision and
consolidate Nodes. This means that they need to be explicitly integrated with each supported cloud
provider. The performance and feature set of a given autoscaler can differ between cloud provider
integrations.</p><figure><div class="mermaid">graph TD

and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/karpenter">Karpenter</a> are the two Node autoscalers currently
sponsored by <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-autoscaling">SIG Autoscaling</a>.</p><p>From the perspective of a cluster user, both autoscalers should provide a similar Node autoscaling
experience. Both will provision new Nodes for unschedulable Pods, and both will consolidate the
Nodes that are no longer optimally utilized.</p><p>Different autoscalers may also provide features outside the Node autoscaling scope described on this
page, and those additional features may differ between them.</p><p>Consult the sections below, and the linked documentation for the individual autoscalers to decide
which autoscaler fits your use case better.</p><h4 id="cluster-autoscaler">Cluster Autoscaler</h4><p>Cluster Autoscaler adds or removes Nodes to pre-configured <em>Node groups</em>. Node groups generally map
to some sort of cloud provider resource group (most commonly a Virtual Machine group). A single
instance of Cluster Autoscaler can simultaneously manage multiple Node groups. When provisioning,
Cluster Autoscaler will add Nodes to the group that best fits the requests of pending Pods. When
consolidating, Cluster Autoscaler always selects specific Nodes to remove, as opposed to just
resizing the underlying cloud provider resource group.</p><p>Additional context:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/README.md">Documentation overview</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/README.md#faqdocumentation">Cloud provider integrations</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md">Cluster Autoscaler FAQ</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-autoscaling#contact">Contact</a></li></ul><h4 id="karpenter">Karpenter</h4><p>Karpenter auto-provisions Nodes based on <a href="https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/nodepools/">NodePool</a>
configurations provided by the cluster operator. Karpenter handles all aspects of node lifecycle,
not just autoscaling. This includes automatically refreshing Nodes once they reach a certain
lifetime, and auto-upgrading Nodes when new worker Node images are released. It works directly with
individual cloud provider resources (most commonly individual Virtual Machines), and doesn't rely on
cloud provider resource groups.</p><p>Additional context:</p><ul><li><a href="https://karpenter.sh/">Documentation</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/karpenter?tab=readme-ov-file#karpenter-implementations">Cloud provider integrations</a></li><li><a href="https://karpenter.sh/docs/faq/">Karpenter FAQ</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/karpenter#community-discussion-contribution-and-support">Contact</a></li></ul><h4 id="implementation-comparison">Implementation comparison</h4><p>Main differences between Cluster Autoscaler and Karpenter:</p><ul><li>Cluster Autoscaler provides features related to just Node autoscaling. Karpenter has a wider
scope, and also provides features intended for managing Node lifecycle altogether (for example,
utilizing disruption to auto-recreate Nodes once they reach a certain lifetime, or auto-upgrade
them to new versions).</li><li>Cluster Autoscaler doesn't support auto-provisioning, the Node groups it can provision from have
to be pre-configured. Karpenter supports auto-provisioning, so the user only has to configure a
set of constraints for the provisioned Nodes, instead of fully configuring homogenous groups.</li><li>Cluster Autoscaler provides cloud provider integrations directly, which means that they're a part
of the Kubernetes project. For Karpenter, the Kubernetes project publishes Karpenter as a library
that cloud providers can integrate with to build a Node autoscaler.</li><li>Cluster Autoscaler provides integrations with numerous cloud providers, including smaller and less
popular providers. There are fewer cloud providers that integrate with Karpenter, including
<a href="https://github.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws">AWS</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/Azure/karpenter-provider-azure">Azure</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="combine-workload-and-node-autoscaling">Combine workload and Node autoscaling</h2><h3 id="horizontal-workload-autoscaling">Horizontal workload autoscaling</h3><p>Node autoscaling usually works in response to Pods—it provisions new Nodes to accommodate
unschedulable Pods, and then consolidates the Nodes once they're no longer needed.</p><p><a href="/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/#scaling-workloads-horizontally">Horizontal workload autoscaling</a>
automatically scales the number of workload replicas to maintain a desired average resource
utilization across the replicas. In other words, it automatically creates new Pods in response to
application load, and then removes the Pods once the load decreases.</p><p>You can use Node autoscaling together with horizontal workload autoscaling to autoscale the Nodes in
your cluster based on the average real resource utilization of your Pods.</p><p>If the application load increases, the average utilization of its Pods should also increase,
prompting workload autoscaling to create new Pods. Node autoscaling should then provision new Nodes
to accommodate the new Pods.</p><p>Once the application load decreases, workload autoscaling should remove unnecessary Pods. Node
autoscaling should, in turn, consolidate the Nodes that are no longer needed.</p><p>If configured correctly, this pattern ensures that your application always has the Node capacity to
handle load spikes if needed, but you don't have to pay for the capacity when it's not needed.</p><h3 id="vertical-workload-autoscaling">Vertical workload autoscaling</h3><p>When using Node autoscaling, it's important to set Pod resource requests correctly. If the requests
of a given Pod are too low, provisioning a new Node for it might not help the Pod actually run.
If the requests of a given Pod are too high, it might incorrectly prevent consolidating its Node.</p><p><a href="/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/#scaling-workloads-vertically">Vertical workload autoscaling</a>

resource requests of your Pods while preserving Node autoscaling capabilities in your cluster.</p><div class="alert alert-caution" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Caution:</h4>When using Node autoscaling, it's not recommended to set up vertical workload autoscaling for
DaemonSet Pods. Autoscalers have to predict what DaemonSet Pods on a new Node will look like in
order to predict available Node resources. Vertical workload autoscaling might make these
predictions unreliable, leading to incorrect scaling decisions.</div><h2 id="related-components">Related components</h2><p>This section describes components providing functionality related to Node autoscaling.</p><h3 id="descheduler">Descheduler</h3><p>The <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler">descheduler</a> is a component providing Node
