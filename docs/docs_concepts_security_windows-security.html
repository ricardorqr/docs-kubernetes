storage (as compared to using tmpfs / in-memory filesystems on Linux). As a cluster
operator, you should take both of the following additional measures:</p><ol><li>Use file ACLs to secure the Secrets' file location.</li><li>Apply volume-level encryption using

can be specified for Windows Pods or containers to execute the container
processes as specific user. This is roughly equivalent to
<a href="/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/#users-and-groups">RunAsUser</a>.</p><p>Windows containers offer two default user accounts, ContainerUser and ContainerAdministrator.
The differences between these two user accounts are covered in
