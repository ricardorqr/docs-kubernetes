admission controller. This can be done effectively using a combination of dry-run and <code>audit</code> and
<code>warn</code> modes, although this becomes harder if mutating PSPs are used.</p><h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2><p>Your Kubernetes server must be at or later than version v1.22.</p><p>To check the version, enter <code>kubectl version</code>.</p><p>If you are currently running a version of Kubernetes other than

concepts.</p><h2 id="overall-approach">Overall approach</h2><p>There are multiple strategies you can take for migrating from PodSecurityPolicy to Pod Security
Admission. The following steps are one possible migration path, with a goal of minimizing both the
risks of a production outage and of a security gap.</p><ol start="0"><li>Decide whether Pod Security Admission is the right fit for your use case.</li><li>Review namespace permissions</li><li>Simplify &amp; standardize PodSecurityPolicies</li><li>Update namespaces<ol><li>Identify an appropriate Pod Security level</li><li>Verify the Pod Security level</li><li>Enforce the Pod Security level</li><li>Bypass PodSecurityPolicy</li></ol></li><li>Review namespace creation processes</li><li>Disable PodSecurityPolicy</li></ol><h2 id="is-psa-right-for-you">0. Decide whether Pod Security Admission is right for you</h2><p>Pod Security Admission was designed to meet the most common security needs out of the box, and to
provide a standard set of security levels across clusters. However, it is less flexible than
PodSecurityPolicy. Notably, the following features are supported by PodSecurityPolicy but not Pod
Security Admission:</p><ul><li><strong>Setting default security constraints</strong> - Pod Security Admission is a non-mutating admission
controller, meaning it won't modify pods before validating them. If you were relying on this
aspect of PSP, you will need to either modify your workloads to meet the Pod Security constraints,
or use a <a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/">Mutating Admission Webhook</a>
to make those changes. See <a href="#simplify-psps">Simplify &amp; Standardize PodSecurityPolicies</a> below for more detail.</li><li><strong>Fine-grained control over policy definition</strong> - Pod Security Admission only supports
<a href="/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/">3 standard levels</a>.
If you require more control over specific constraints, then you will need to use a
<a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/">Validating Admission Webhook</a>
to enforce those policies.</li><li><strong>Sub-namespace policy granularity</strong> - PodSecurityPolicy lets you bind different policies to
different Service Accounts or users, even within a single namespace. This approach has many
pitfalls and is not recommended, but if you require this feature anyway you will
need to use a 3rd party webhook instead. The exception to this is if you only need to completely exempt
specific users or <a href="/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/">RuntimeClasses</a>, in which case Pod
Security Admission does expose some
<a href="/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/#exemptions">static configuration for exemptions</a>.</li></ul><p>Even if Pod Security Admission does not meet all of your needs it was designed to be <em>complementary</em>
to other policy enforcement mechanisms, and can provide a useful fallback running alongside other
admission webhooks.</p><h2 id="review-namespace-permissions">1. Review namespace permissions</h2><p>Pod Security Admission is controlled by <a href="/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/#pod-security-admission-labels-for-namespaces">labels on
namespaces</a>.
This means that anyone who can update (or patch or create) a namespace can also modify the Pod
Security level for that namespace, which could be used to bypass a more restrictive policy. Before
proceeding, ensure that only trusted, privileged users have these namespace permissions. It is not
recommended to grant these powerful permissions to users that shouldn't have elevated permissions,
but if you must you will need to use an
<a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/">admission webhook</a>
to place additional restrictions on setting Pod Security labels on Namespace objects.</p><h2 id="simplify-psps">2. Simplify &amp; standardize PodSecurityPolicies</h2><p>In this section, you will reduce mutating PodSecurityPolicies and remove options that are outside
the scope of the Pod Security Standards. You should make the changes recommended here to an offline
copy of the original PodSecurityPolicy being modified. The cloned PSP should have a different
name that is alphabetically before the original (for example, prepend a <code>0</code> to it). Do not create the
new policies in Kubernetes yet - that will be covered in the <a href="#psp-update-rollout">Rollout the updated
policies</a> section below.</p><h3 id="eliminate-mutating-fields">2.a. Eliminate purely mutating fields</h3><p>If a PodSecurityPolicy is mutating pods, then you could end up with pods that don't meet the Pod
Security level requirements when you finally turn PodSecurityPolicy off. In order to avoid this, you
should eliminate all PSP mutation prior to switching over. Unfortunately PSP does not cleanly
separate mutating &amp; validating fields, so this is not a straightforward migration.</p><p>You can start by eliminating the fields that are purely mutating, and don't have any bearing on the
validating policy. These fields (also listed in the
<a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/psp-to-pod-security-standards/">Mapping PodSecurityPolicies to Pod Security Standards</a>
reference) are:</p><ul><li><code>.spec.defaultAllowPrivilegeEscalation</code></li><li><code>.spec.runtimeClass.defaultRuntimeClassName</code></li><li><code>.metadata.annotations['seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName']</code></li><li><code>.metadata.annotations['apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName']</code></li><li><code>.spec.defaultAddCapabilities</code> - Although technically a mutating &amp; validating field, these should
be merged into <code>.spec.allowedCapabilities</code> which performs the same validation without mutation.</li></ul><div class="alert alert-caution" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Caution:</h4>Removing these could result in workloads missing required configuration, and cause problems. See
<a href="#psp-update-rollout">Rollout the updated policies</a> below for advice on how to roll these changes
out safely.</div><h3 id="eliminate-non-standard-options">2.b. Eliminate options not covered by the Pod Security Standards</h3><p>There are several fields in PodSecurityPolicy that are not covered by the Pod Security Standards. If
you must enforce these options, you will need to supplement Pod Security Admission with an
<a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/">admission webhook</a>,
which is outside the scope of this guide.</p><p>First, you can remove the purely validating fields that the Pod Security Standards do not cover.
These fields (also listed in the
<a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/psp-to-pod-security-standards/">Mapping PodSecurityPolicies to Pod Security Standards</a>
reference with "no opinion") are:</p><ul><li><code>.spec.allowedHostPaths</code></li><li><code>.spec.allowedFlexVolumes</code></li><li><code>.spec.allowedCSIDrivers</code></li><li><code>.spec.forbiddenSysctls</code></li><li><code>.spec.runtimeClass</code></li></ul><p>You can also remove the following fields, that are related to POSIX / UNIX group controls.</p><div class="alert alert-caution" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Caution:</h4>If any of these use the <code>MustRunAs</code> strategy they may be mutating! Removing these could result in
workloads not setting the required groups, and cause problems. See
<a href="#psp-update-rollout">Rollout the updated policies</a> below for advice on how to roll these changes
out safely.</div><ul><li><code>.spec.runAsGroup</code></li><li><code>.spec.supplementalGroups</code></li><li><code>.spec.fsGroup</code></li></ul><p>The remaining mutating fields are required to properly support the Pod Security Standards, and will
need to be handled on a case-by-case basis later:</p><ul><li><code>.spec.requiredDropCapabilities</code> - Required to drop <code>ALL</code> for the Restricted profile.</li><li><code>.spec.seLinux</code> - (Only mutating with the <code>MustRunAs</code> rule) required to enforce the SELinux
requirements of the Baseline &amp; Restricted profiles.</li><li><code>.spec.runAsUser</code> - (Non-mutating with the <code>RunAsAny</code> rule) required to enforce <code>RunAsNonRoot</code> for
the Restricted profile.</li><li><code>.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation</code> - (Only mutating if set to <code>false</code>) required for the Restricted
profile.</li></ul><h3 id="psp-update-rollout">2.c. Rollout the updated PSPs</h3><p>Next, you can rollout the updated policies to your cluster. You should proceed with caution, as
removing the mutating options may result in workloads missing required configuration.</p><p>For each updated PodSecurityPolicy:</p><ol><li>Identify pods running under the original PSP. This can be done using the <code>kubernetes.io/psp</code>
annotation. For example, using kubectl:<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex"><span><span style="color:#b8860b">PSP_NAME</span><span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#b44">"original"</span> <span style="color:#080;font-style:italic"># Set the name of the PSP you're checking for</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex"><span>kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o <span style="color:#b8860b">jsonpath</span><span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#b44">"{range .items[?(@.metadata.annotations.kubernetes\.io\/psp=='</span><span style="color:#b8860b">$PSP_NAME</span><span style="color:#b44">')]}{.metadata.namespace} {.metadata.name}{'\n'}{end}"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div></li><li>Compare these running pods against the original pod spec to determine whether PodSecurityPolicy
has modified the pod. For pods created by a <a href="/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/">workload resource</a>
you can compare the pod with the PodTemplate in the controller resource. If any changes are
identified, the original Pod or PodTemplate should be updated with the desired configuration.
The fields to review are:<ul><li><code>.metadata.annotations['container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/*']</code> (replace * with each container name)</li><li><code>.spec.runtimeClassName</code></li><li><code>.spec.securityContext.fsGroup</code></li><li><code>.spec.securityContext.seccompProfile</code></li><li><code>.spec.securityContext.seLinuxOptions</code></li><li><code>.spec.securityContext.supplementalGroups</code></li><li>On containers, under <code>.spec.containers[*]</code> and <code>.spec.initContainers[*]</code>:<ul><li><code>.securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation</code></li><li><code>.securityContext.capabilities.add</code></li><li><code>.securityContext.capabilities.drop</code></li><li><code>.securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem</code></li><li><code>.securityContext.runAsGroup</code></li><li><code>.securityContext.runAsNonRoot</code></li><li><code>.securityContext.runAsUser</code></li><li><code>.securityContext.seccompProfile</code></li><li><code>.securityContext.seLinuxOptions</code></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Create the new PodSecurityPolicies. If any Roles or ClusterRoles are granting <code>use</code> on all PSPs
this could cause the new PSPs to be used instead of their mutating counter-parts.</li><li>Update your authorization to grant access to the new PSPs. In RBAC this means updating any Roles
or ClusterRoles that grant the <code>use</code> permission on the original PSP to also grant it to the
updated PSP.</li><li>Verify: after some soak time, rerun the command from step 1 to see if any pods are still using
the original PSPs. Note that pods need to be recreated after the new policies have been rolled
out before they can be fully verified.</li><li>(optional) Once you have verified that the original PSPs are no longer in use, you can delete
them.</li></ol><h2 id="update-namespaces">3. Update Namespaces</h2><p>The following steps will need to be performed on every namespace in the cluster. Commands referenced
in these steps use the <code>$NAMESPACE</code> variable to refer to the namespace being updated.</p><h3 id="identify-appropriate-level">3.a. Identify an appropriate Pod Security level</h3><p>Start reviewing the <a href="/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/">Pod Security Standards</a> and
familiarizing yourself with the 3 different levels.</p><p>There are several ways to choose a Pod Security level for your namespace:</p><ol><li><strong>By security requirements for the namespace</strong> - If you are familiar with the expected access
level for the namespace, you can choose an appropriate level based on those requirements, similar
to how one might approach this on a new cluster.</li><li><strong>By existing PodSecurityPolicies</strong> - Using the
<a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/psp-to-pod-security-standards/">Mapping PodSecurityPolicies to Pod Security Standards</a>
reference you can map each
PSP to a Pod Security Standard level. If your PSPs aren't based on the Pod Security Standards, you
may need to decide between choosing a level that is at least as permissive as the PSP, and a
level that is at least as restrictive. You can see which PSPs are in use for pods in a given
namespace with this command:<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex"><span>kubectl get pods -n <span style="color:#b8860b">$NAMESPACE</span> -o <span style="color:#b8860b">jsonpath</span><span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#b44">"{.items[*].metadata.annotations.kubernetes\.io\/psp}"</span> | tr <span style="color:#b44">" "</span> <span style="color:#b44">"\n"</span> | sort -u
</span></span></code></pre></div></li><li><strong>By existing pods</strong> - Using the strategies under <a href="#verify-pss-level">Verify the Pod Security level</a>,
you can test out both the Baseline and Restricted levels to see
whether they are sufficiently permissive for existing workloads, and chose the least-privileged
valid level.</li></ol><div class="alert alert-caution" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Caution:</h4>Options 2 &amp; 3 above are based on <em>existing</em> pods, and may miss workloads that aren't currently
running, such as CronJobs, scale-to-zero workloads, or other workloads that haven't rolled out.</div><h3 id="verify-pss-level">3.b. Verify the Pod Security level</h3><p>Once you have selected a Pod Security level for the namespace (or if you're trying several), it's a
good idea to test it out first (you can skip this step if using the Privileged level). Pod Security
includes several tools to help test and safely roll out profiles.</p><p>First, you can dry-run the policy, which will evaluate pods currently running in the namespace
against the applied policy, without making the new policy take effect:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex"><span><span style="color:#080;font-style:italic"># $LEVEL is the level to dry-run, either "baseline" or "restricted".</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex"><span>kubectl label --dry-run<span style="color:#666">=</span>server --overwrite ns <span style="color:#b8860b">$NAMESPACE</span> pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce<span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#b8860b">$LEVEL</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This command will return a warning for any <em>existing</em> pods that are not valid under the proposed
level.</p><p>The second option is better for catching workloads that are not currently running: audit mode. When
running under audit-mode (as opposed to enforcing), pods that violate the policy level are recorded
in the audit logs, which can be reviewed later after some soak time, but are not forbidden. Warning
mode works similarly, but returns the warning to the user immediately. You can set the audit level
on a namespace with this command:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex"><span>kubectl label --overwrite ns <span style="color:#b8860b">$NAMESPACE</span> pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit<span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#b8860b">$LEVEL</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If either of these approaches yield unexpected violations, you will need to either update the
violating workloads to meet the policy requirements, or relax the namespace Pod Security level.</p><h3 id="enforce-pod-security-level">3.c. Enforce the Pod Security level</h3><p>When you are satisfied that the chosen level can safely be enforced on the namespace, you can update
the namespace to enforce the desired level:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex"><span>kubectl label --overwrite ns <span style="color:#b8860b">$NAMESPACE</span> pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce<span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#b8860b">$LEVEL</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="bypass-psp">3.d. Bypass PodSecurityPolicy</h3><p>Finally, you can effectively bypass PodSecurityPolicy at the namespace level by binding the fully
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/policy/privileged-psp.yaml" download="policy/privileged-psp.yaml">privileged PSP</a>
to all service
accounts in the namespace.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex"><span><span style="color:#080;font-style:italic"># The following cluster-scoped commands are only needed once.</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since the privileged PSP is non-mutating, and the PSP admission controller always
prefers non-mutating PSPs, this will ensure that pods in this namespace are no longer being modified
or restricted by PodSecurityPolicy.</p><p>The advantage to disabling PodSecurityPolicy on a per-namespace basis like this is if a problem
arises you can easily roll the change back by deleting the RoleBinding. Just make sure the
pre-existing PodSecurityPolicies are still in place!</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex"><span><span style="color:#080;font-style:italic"># Undo PodSecurityPolicy disablement.</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="review-namespace-creation-process">4. Review namespace creation processes</h2><p>Now that existing namespaces have been updated to enforce Pod Security Admission, you should ensure
that your processes and/or policies for creating new namespaces are updated to ensure that an
appropriate Pod Security profile is applied to new namespaces.</p><p>You can also statically configure the Pod Security admission controller to set a default enforce,
audit, and/or warn level for unlabeled namespaces. See
<a href="/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/enforce-standards-admission-controller/#configure-the-admission-controller">Configure the Admission Controller</a>
for more information.</p><h2 id="disable-psp">5. Disable PodSecurityPolicy</h2><p>Finally, you're ready to disable PodSecurityPolicy. To do so, you will need to modify the admission
configuration of the API server:

a test by impersonating a user without access to any PodSecurityPolicies (see the
<a href="/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/#example">PodSecurityPolicy example</a>), or by verifying in
the API server logs. At startup, the API server outputs log lines listing the loaded admission
controller plugins:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>I0218 00:59:44.903329      13 plugins.go:158] Loaded 16 mutating admission controller(s) successfully in the following order: NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,NodeRestriction,TaintNodesByCondition,Priority,DefaultTolerationSeconds,ExtendedResourceToleration,PersistentVolumeLabel,DefaultStorageClass,StorageObjectInUseProtection,RuntimeClass,DefaultIngressClass,MutatingAdmissionWebhook.

associated Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings (just make sure they don't
grant any other unrelated permissions).</p></div>
