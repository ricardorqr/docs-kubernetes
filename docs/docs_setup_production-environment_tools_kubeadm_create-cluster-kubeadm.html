Using <code>kubeadm</code>, you can create a minimum viable Kubernetes cluster that conforms to best practices.
In fact, you can use <code>kubeadm</code> to set up a cluster that will pass the
<a href="/blog/2017/10/software-conformance-certification/">Kubernetes Conformance tests</a>.
<code>kubeadm</code> also supports other cluster lifecycle functions, such as
<a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/bootstrap-tokens/">bootstrap tokens</a> and cluster upgrades.</p><p>The <code>kubeadm</code> tool is good if you need:</p><ul><li>A simple way for you to try out Kubernetes, possibly for the first time.</li><li>A way for existing users to automate setting up a cluster and test their application.</li><li>A building block in other ecosystem and/or installer tools with a larger
scope.</li></ul><p>You can install and use <code>kubeadm</code> on various machines: your laptop, a set
of cloud servers, a Raspberry Pi, and more. Whether you're deploying into the
cloud or on-premises, you can integrate <code>kubeadm</code> into provisioning systems such
as Ansible or Terraform.</p><h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2><p>To follow this guide, you need:</p><ul><li>One or more machines running a deb/rpm-compatible Linux OS; for example: Ubuntu or CentOS.</li><li>2 GiB or more of RAM per machine--any less leaves little room for your apps.</li><li>At least 2 CPUs on the machine that you use as a control-plane node.</li><li>Full network connectivity among all machines in the cluster. You can use either a
public or a private network.</li></ul><p>You also need to use a version of <code>kubeadm</code> that can deploy the version
of Kubernetes that you want to use in your new cluster.</p><p><a href="/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/#supported-versions">Kubernetes' version and version skew support policy</a>
applies to <code>kubeadm</code> as well as to Kubernetes overall.
Check that policy to learn about what versions of Kubernetes and <code>kubeadm</code>
are supported. This page is written for Kubernetes v1.34.</p><p>The <code>kubeadm</code> tool's overall feature state is General Availability (GA). Some sub-features are
still under active development. The implementation of creating the cluster may change
slightly as the tool evolves, but the overall implementation should be pretty stable.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>Any commands under <code>kubeadm alpha</code> are, by definition, supported on an alpha level.</div><h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2><ul><li>Install a single control-plane Kubernetes cluster</li><li>Install a Pod network on the cluster so that your Pods can

try to use the first one it encounters that has a suitable global unicast IP address.
While making this choice, the exact ordering of gateways might vary between different
operating systems and kernel versions.</div><p>Kubernetes components do not accept custom network interface as an option,
therefore a custom IP address must be passed as a flag to all components instances

<code>init</code> and <code>join</code>, the flag <code>--apiserver-advertise-address</code> can be used.
Preferably, this option can be set in the <a href="/docs/reference/config-api/kubeadm-config.v1beta4/">kubeadm API</a>
as <code>InitConfiguration.localAPIEndpoint</code> and <code>JoinConfiguration.controlPlane.localAPIEndpoint</code>.</p><p>For kubelets on all nodes, the <code>--node-ip</code> option can be passed in

signing new certificates and restarting the affected components, so that the change in

with custom IP addresses). Instead, the Kubernetes maintainers recommend to setup the host network,
so that the default gateway IP is the one that Kubernetes components auto-detect and use.
On Linux nodes, you can use commands such as <code>ip route</code> to configure networking; your operating
system might also provide higher level network management tools. If your node's default gateway
is a public IP address, you should configure packet filtering or other security measures that
protect the nodes and your cluster.</div><h3 id="preparing-the-required-container-images">Preparing the required container images</h3><p>This step is optional and only applies in case you wish <code>kubeadm init</code> and <code>kubeadm join</code>

appropriate arguments.</p><h3 id="clean-up-the-control-plane">Clean up the control plane</h3><p>You can use <code>kubeadm reset</code> on the control plane host to trigger a best-effort
clean up.</p><p>See the <a href="/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-reset/"><code>kubeadm reset</code></a>
reference documentation for more information about this subcommand and its
options.</p><h2 id="version-skew-policy">Version skew policy</h2><p>While kubeadm allows version skew against some components that it manages, it is recommended that you
match the kubeadm version with the versions of the control plane components, kube-proxy and kubelet.</p><h3 id="kubeadm-s-skew-against-the-kubernetes-version">kubeadm's skew against the Kubernetes version</h3><p>kubeadm can be used with Kubernetes components that are the same version as kubeadm
or one version older. The Kubernetes version can be specified to kubeadm by using the
<code>--kubernetes-version</code> flag of <code>kubeadm init</code> or the
<a href="/docs/reference/config-api/kubeadm-config.v1beta4/"><code>ClusterConfiguration.kubernetesVersion</code></a>
field when using <code>--config</code>. This option will control the versions
of kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler and kube-proxy.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li>kubeadm is at 1.34</li><li><code>kubernetesVersion</code> must be at 1.34 or 1.33</li></ul><h3 id="kubeadm-s-skew-against-the-kubelet">kubeadm's skew against the kubelet</h3><p>Similarly to the Kubernetes version, kubeadm can be used with a kubelet version that is
the same version as kubeadm or three versions older.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li>kubeadm is at 1.34</li><li>kubelet on the host must be at 1.34, 1.33,
1.32 or 1.31</li></ul><h3 id="kubeadm-s-skew-against-kubeadm">kubeadm's skew against kubeadm</h3><p>There are certain limitations on how kubeadm commands can operate on existing nodes or whole clusters
managed by kubeadm.</p><p>If new nodes are joined to the cluster, the kubeadm binary used for <code>kubeadm join</code> must match
the last version of kubeadm used to either create the cluster with <code>kubeadm init</code> or to upgrade
the same node with <code>kubeadm upgrade</code>. Similar rules apply to the rest of the kubeadm commands
with the exception of <code>kubeadm upgrade</code>.</p><p>Example for <code>kubeadm join</code>:</p><ul><li>kubeadm version 1.34 was used to create a cluster with <code>kubeadm init</code></li><li>Joining nodes must use a kubeadm binary that is at version 1.34</li></ul><p>Nodes that are being upgraded must use a version of kubeadm that is the same MINOR
version or one MINOR version newer than the version of kubeadm used for managing the
node.</p><p>Example for <code>kubeadm upgrade</code>:</p><ul><li>kubeadm version 1.33 was used to create or upgrade the node</li><li>The version of kubeadm used for upgrading the node must be at 1.33
or 1.34</li></ul><p>To learn more about the version skew between the different Kubernetes component see

running on it. This means that if the control-plane node fails, your cluster may lose
data and may need to be recreated from scratch.</p><p>Workarounds:</p><ul><li><p>Regularly <a href="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/recovery/">back up etcd</a>. The
etcd data directory configured by kubeadm is at <code>/var/lib/etcd</code> on the control-plane node.</p></li><li><p>Use multiple control-plane nodes. You can read
<a href="/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/ha-topology/">Options for Highly Available topology</a> to pick a cluster
topology that provides <a href="/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/">high-availability</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="multi-platform">Platform compatibility</h3><p>kubeadm deb/rpm packages and binaries are built for amd64, arm (32-bit), arm64, ppc64le, and s390x
following the <a href="https://git.k8s.io/design-proposals-archive/multi-platform.md">multi-platform proposal</a>.</p><p>Multiplatform container images for the control plane and addons are also supported since v1.12.</p><p>Only some of the network providers offer solutions for all platforms.
