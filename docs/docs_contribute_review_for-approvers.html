<div class="td-content"><h1 data-pagefind-weight="10">Reviewing for approvers and reviewers</h1><p>SIG Docs <a href="/docs/contribute/participate/#reviewers">Reviewers</a> and
<a href="/docs/contribute/participate/#approvers">Approvers</a> do a few extra things
when reviewing a change.</p><p>Every week a specific docs approver volunteers to triage and review pull requests.
This person is the "PR Wrangler" for the week. See the
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/wiki/PR-Wranglers">PR Wrangler scheduler</a>
for more information. To become a PR Wrangler, attend the weekly SIG Docs meeting
and volunteer. Even if you are not on the schedule for the current week, you can
still review pull requests (PRs) that are not already under active review.</p><p>In addition to the rotation, a bot assigns reviewers and approvers
for the PR based on the owners for the affected files.</p><h2 id="reviewing-a-pr">Reviewing a PR</h2><p>Kubernetes documentation follows the
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/owners.md#the-code-review-process">Kubernetes code review process</a>.</p><p>Everything described in <a href="/docs/contribute/review/reviewing-prs/">Reviewing a pull request</a>
applies, but Reviewers and Approvers should also do the following:</p><ul><li><p>Using the <code>/assign</code> Prow command to assign a specific reviewer to a PR as needed.
This is extra important when it comes to requesting technical review from code contributors.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>Look at the <code>reviewers</code> field in the front-matter at the top of a Markdown file to see who can
provide technical review.</div></li><li><p>Making sure the PR follows the <a href="/docs/contribute/style/content-guide/">Content</a>
and <a href="/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/">Style</a> guides; link the author to the
relevant part of the guide(s) if it doesn't.</p></li><li><p>Using the GitHub <strong>Request Changes</strong> option when applicable to suggest changes to the PR author.</p></li><li><p>Changing your review status in GitHub using the <code>/approve</code> or <code>/lgtm</code> Prow commands,
if your suggestions are implemented.</p></li></ul><h2 id="commit-into-another-person-s-pr">Commit into another person's PR</h2><p>Leaving PR comments is helpful, but there might be times when you need to commit
into another person's PR instead.</p><p>Do not "take over" for another person unless they explicitly ask
you to, or you want to resurrect a long-abandoned PR. While it may be faster
in the short term, it deprives the person of the chance to contribute.</p><p>The process you use depends on whether you need to edit a file that is already
in the scope of the PR, or a file that the PR has not yet touched.</p><p>You can't commit into someone else's PR if either of the following things is
true:</p><ul><li><p>If the PR author pushed their branch directly to the
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/">https://github.com/kubernetes/website/</a>
repository. Only a reviewer with push access can commit to another user's PR.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Note:</h4>Encourage the author to push their branch to their fork before
opening the PR next time.</div></li><li><p>The PR author explicitly disallows edits from approvers.</p></li></ul><h2 id="prow-commands-for-reviewing">Prow commands for reviewing</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/README.md">Prow</a> is
the Kubernetes-based CI/CD system that runs jobs against pull requests (PRs). Prow
enables chatbot-style commands to handle GitHub actions across the Kubernetes
organization, like <a href="#adding-and-removing-issue-labels">adding and removing labels</a>,
closing issues, and assigning an approver. Enter Prow commands as GitHub comments
using the <code>/&lt;command-name&gt;</code> format.</p><p>The most common prow commands reviewers and approvers use are:</p><table><caption style="display:none">Prow commands for reviewing</caption><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left">Prow Command</th><th style="text-align:left">Role Restrictions</th><th style="text-align:left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left"><code>/lgtm</code></td><td style="text-align:left">Organization members</td><td style="text-align:left">Signals that you've finished reviewing a PR and are satisfied with the changes.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left"><code>/approve</code></td><td style="text-align:left">Approvers</td><td style="text-align:left">Approves a PR for merging.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left"><code>/assign</code></td><td style="text-align:left">Anyone</td><td style="text-align:left">Assigns a person to review or approve a PR</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left"><code>/close</code></td><td style="text-align:left">Organization members</td><td style="text-align:left">Closes an issue or PR.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left"><code>/hold</code></td><td style="text-align:left">Anyone</td><td style="text-align:left">Adds the <code>do-not-merge/hold</code> label, indicating the PR cannot be automatically merged.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left"><code>/hold cancel</code></td><td style="text-align:left">Anyone</td><td style="text-align:left">Removes the <code>do-not-merge/hold</code> label.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To view the commands that you can use in a PR, see the

(especially if it's quick or relates to work you're already doing).</p><p>If you have questions about triaging an issue, ask in <code>#sig-docs</code> on Slack or
the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-docs">kubernetes-sig-docs mailing list</a>.</p><h2 id="adding-and-removing-issue-labels">Adding and removing issue labels</h2><p>To add a label, leave a comment in one of the following formats:</p><ul><li><code>/&lt;label-to-add&gt;</code> (for example, <code>/good-first-issue</code>)</li><li><code>/&lt;label-category&gt; &lt;label-to-add&gt;</code> (for example, <code>/triage needs-information</code> or <code>/language ja</code>)</li></ul><p>To remove a label, leave a comment in one of the following formats:</p><ul><li><code>/remove-&lt;label-to-remove&gt;</code> (for example, <code>/remove-help</code>)</li><li><code>/remove-&lt;label-category&gt; &lt;label-to-remove&gt;</code> (for example, <code>/remove-triage needs-information</code>)</li></ul><p>In both cases, the label must already exist.

silently ignored.</p><p>For a list of all labels, see the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/labels">website repository's Labels section</a>.
Not all labels are used by SIG Docs.</p><h3 id="issue-lifecycle-labels">Issue lifecycle labels</h3><p>Issues are generally opened and closed quickly.
However, sometimes an issue is inactive after its opened.
Other times, an issue may need to remain open for longer than 90 days.</p><table><caption style="display:none">Issue lifecycle labels</caption><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left">Label</th><th style="text-align:left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left"><code>lifecycle/stale</code></td><td style="text-align:left">After 90 days with no activity, an issue is automatically labeled as stale.

to handle them.</p><h3 id="duplicate-issues">Duplicate issues</h3><p>If a single problem has one or more issues open for it, combine them into a single issue.
You should decide which issue to keep open (or
open a new issue), then move over all relevant information and link related issues.
Finally, label all other issues that describe the same problem with
<code>triage/duplicate</code> and close them. Only having a single issue to work on reduces confusion
and avoids duplicate work on the same problem.</p><h3 id="dead-link-issues">Dead link issues</h3><p>If the dead link issue is in the API or <code>kubectl</code> documentation, assign them
<code>/priority critical-urgent</code> until the problem is fully understood. Assign all
other dead link issues <code>/priority important-longterm</code>, as they must be manually fixed.</p><h3 id="blog-issues">Blog issues</h3><p>We expect <a href="/blog/">Kubernetes Blog</a> entries to become
outdated over time. Therefore, we only maintain blog entries less than a year old.
If an issue is related to a blog entry that is more than one year old,
you should typically close the issue without fixing.</p><p>You can send a link to <a href="/docs/contribute/blog/#maintenance">article updates and maintenance</a>
as part of the message you send when you close the PR.</p><p>It is OK to make an exception where a relevant justification applies.</p><h3 id="support-requests-or-code-bug-reports">Support requests or code bug reports</h3><p>Some docs issues are actually issues with the underlying code, or requests for
assistance when something, for example a tutorial, doesn't work.
For issues unrelated to docs, close the issue with the <code>kind/support</code> label and a comment
directing the requester to support venues (Slack, Stack Overflow) and, if
relevant, the repository to file an issue for bugs with features (<code>kubernetes/kubernetes</code>
is a great place to start).</p><p>Sample response to a request for support:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-none" data-lang="none">This issue sounds more like a request for support and less
like an issue specifically for docs. I encourage you to bring
your question to the `#kubernetes-users` channel in
[Kubernetes slack](https://slack.k8s.io/). You can also search
resources like
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kubernetes)

</code></pre><h3 id="squashing">Squashing</h3><p>As an approver, when you review pull requests (PRs), there are various cases
where you might do the following:</p><ul><li>Advise the contributor to squash their commits.</li><li>Squash the commits for the contributor.</li><li>Advise the contributor not to squash yet.</li><li>Prevent squashing.</li></ul><p><strong>Advising contributors to squash</strong>: A new contributor might not know that they
should squash commits in their pull requests (PRs). If this is the case, advise
them to do so, provide links to useful information, and offer to arrange help if
they need it. Some useful links:</p><ul><li><a href="/docs/contribute/new-content/open-a-pr/#squashing-commits">Opening pull requests and squashing your commits</a>
for documentation contributors.</li><li><a href="https://www.k8s.dev/docs/guide/github-workflow/">GitHub Workflow</a>, including diagrams, for developers.</li></ul><p><strong>Squashing commits for contributors</strong>: If a contributor might have difficulty
squashing commits or there is time pressure to merge a PR, you can perform the
squash for them:</p><ul><li>The kubernetes/website repo is
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-squashing-for-pull-requests">configured to allow squashing for pull request merges</a>.
Simply select the <em>Squash commits</em> button.</li><li>In the PR, if the contributor enables maintainers to manage the PR, you can
squash their commits and update their fork with the result. Before you squash,
advise them to save and push their latest changes to the PR. After you squash,
advise them to pull the squashed commit to their local clone.</li><li>You can get GitHub to squash the commits by using a label so that Tide / GitHub
performs the squash or by clicking the <em>Squash commits</em> button when you merge the PR.</li></ul><p><strong>Advise contributors to avoid squashing</strong></p><ul><li>If one commit does something broken or unwise, and the last commit reverts this
error, don't squash the commits. Even though the "Files changed" tab in the PR
on GitHub and the Netlify preview will both look OK, merging this PR might create
rebase or merge conflicts for other folks. Intervene as you see fit to avoid that
risk to other contributors.</li></ul><p><strong>Never squash</strong></p><ul><li>If you're launching a localization or releasing the docs for a new version,
you are merging in a branch that's not from a user's fork, <em>never squash the commits</em>.
Not squashing is essential because you must maintain the commit history for those files.</li></ul></div>
