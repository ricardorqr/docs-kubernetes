For
every Pod that the scheduler discovers, the scheduler becomes responsible
for finding the best Node for that Pod to run on. The scheduler reaches
this placement decision taking into account the scheduling principles
described below.</p><p>If you want to understand why Pods are placed onto a particular Node,
or if you're planning to implement a custom scheduler yourself, this
page will help you learn about scheduling.</p><h2 id="kube-scheduler">kube-scheduler</h2><p><a href="/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/">kube-scheduler</a>
is the default scheduler for Kubernetes and runs as part of the
<a class="glossary-tooltip" title="The container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of containers." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-control-plane" target="_blank" aria-label="control plane">control plane</a>.
kube-scheduler is designed so that, if you want and need to, you can
write your own scheduling component and use that instead.</p><p>Kube-scheduler selects an optimal node to run newly created or not yet
scheduled (unscheduled) pods. Since containers in pods - and pods themselves -
can have different requirements, the scheduler filters out any nodes that
don't meet a Pod's specific scheduling needs. Alternatively, the API lets
you specify a node for a Pod when you create it, but this is unusual
and is only done in special cases.</p><p>In a cluster, Nodes that meet the scheduling requirements for a Pod
are called <em>feasible</em> nodes. If none of the nodes are suitable, the pod
remains unscheduled until the scheduler is able to place it.</p><p>The scheduler finds feasible Nodes for a Pod and then runs a set of
functions to score the feasible Nodes and picks a Node with the highest
score among the feasible ones to run the Pod. The scheduler then notifies
the API server about this decision in a process called <em>binding</em>.</p><p>Factors that need to be taken into account for scheduling decisions include
individual and collective resource requirements, hardware / software /
policy constraints, affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data
locality, inter-workload interference, and so on.</p><h3 id="kube-scheduler-implementation">Node selection in kube-scheduler</h3><p>kube-scheduler selects a node for the pod in a 2-step operation:</p><ol><li>Filtering</li><li>Scoring</li></ol><p>The <em>filtering</em> step finds the set of Nodes where it's feasible to
schedule the Pod. For example, the PodFitsResources filter checks whether a
candidate Node has enough available resources to meet a Pod's specific
resource requests. After this step, the node list contains any suitable
Nodes; often, there will be more than one. If the list is empty, that
Pod isn't (yet) schedulable.</p><p>In the <em>scoring</em> step, the scheduler ranks the remaining nodes to choose
the most suitable Pod placement. The scheduler assigns a score to each Node
that survived filtering, basing this score on the active scoring rules.</p><p>Finally, kube-scheduler assigns the Pod to the Node with the highest ranking.
If there is more than one node with equal scores, kube-scheduler selects
one of these at random.</p><p>There are two supported ways to configure the filtering and scoring behavior
of the scheduler:</p><ol><li><a href="/docs/reference/scheduling/policies/">Scheduling Policies</a> allow you to configure <em>Predicates</em> for filtering and <em>Priorities</em> for scoring.</li><li><a href="/docs/reference/scheduling/config/#profiles">Scheduling Profiles</a> allow you to configure Plugins that implement different scheduling stages, including: <code>QueueSort</code>, <code>Filter</code>, <code>Score</code>, <code>Bind</code>, <code>Reserve</code>, <code>Permit</code>, and others. You can also configure the kube-scheduler to run different profiles.</li></ol><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next</h2><ul><li>Read about <a href="/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduler-perf-tuning/">scheduler performance tuning</a></li><li>Read about <a href="/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/">Pod topology spread constraints</a></li><li>Read the <a href="/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/">reference documentation</a> for kube-scheduler</li><li>Read the <a href="/docs/reference/config-api/kube-scheduler-config.v1/">kube-scheduler config (v1)</a> reference</li><li>Learn about <a href="/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/configure-multiple-schedulers/">configuring multiple schedulers</a></li><li>Learn about <a href="/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/topology-manager/">topology management policies</a></li><li>Learn about <a href="/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-overhead/">Pod Overhead</a></li><li>Learn about scheduling of Pods that use volumes in:<ul><li><a href="/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#volume-binding-mode">Volume Topology Support</a></li><li><a href="/docs/concepts/storage/storage-capacity/">Storage Capacity Tracking</a></li><li><a href="/docs/concepts/storage/storage-limits/">Node-specific Volume Limits</a></li></ul></li></ul></div>
