If the object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the policy.</p><p>For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {

A null object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object that cannot have labels (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels.
