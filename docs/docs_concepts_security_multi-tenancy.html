<div class="td-content"><h1 data-pagefind-weight="10">Multi-tenancy</h1><p>This page provides an overview of available configuration options and best practices for cluster
multi-tenancy.</p><p>Sharing clusters saves costs and simplifies administration. However, sharing clusters also
presents challenges such as security, fairness, and managing <em>noisy neighbors</em>.</p><p>Clusters can be shared in many ways. In some cases, different applications may run in the same
cluster. In other cases, multiple instances of the same application may run in the same cluster,
one for each end user. All these types of sharing are frequently described using the umbrella term
<em>multi-tenancy</em>.</p><p>While Kubernetes does not have first-class concepts of end users or tenants, it provides several
features to help manage different tenancy requirements. These are discussed below.</p><h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2><p>The first step to determining how to share your cluster is understanding your use case, so you can
evaluate the patterns and tools available. In general, multi-tenancy in Kubernetes clusters falls
into two broad categories, though many variations and hybrids are also possible.</p><h3 id="multiple-teams">Multiple teams</h3><p>A common form of multi-tenancy is to share a cluster between multiple teams within an
organization, each of whom may operate one or more workloads. These workloads frequently need to
communicate with each other, and with other workloads located on the same or different clusters.</p><p>In this scenario, members of the teams often have direct access to Kubernetes resources via tools
such as <code>kubectl</code>, or indirect access through GitOps controllers or other types of release
automation tools. There is often some level of trust between members of different teams, but
Kubernetes policies such as RBAC, quotas, and network policies are essential to safely and fairly
share clusters.</p><h3 id="multiple-customers">Multiple customers</h3><p>The other major form of multi-tenancy frequently involves a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) vendor
running multiple instances of a workload for customers. This business model is so strongly
associated with this deployment style that many people call it "SaaS tenancy." However, a better
term might be "multi-customer tenancy," since SaaS vendors may also use other deployment models,
and this deployment model can also be used outside of SaaS.</p><p>In this scenario, the customers do not have access to the cluster; Kubernetes is invisible from
their perspective and is only used by the vendor to manage the workloads. Cost optimization is
frequently a critical concern, and Kubernetes policies are used to ensure that the workloads are
strongly isolated from each other.</p><h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2><h3 id="tenants">Tenants</h3><p>When discussing multi-tenancy in Kubernetes, there is no single definition for a "tenant".
Rather, the definition of a tenant will vary depending on whether multi-team or multi-customer
tenancy is being discussed.</p><p>In multi-team usage, a tenant is typically a team, where each team typically deploys a small
number of workloads that scales with the complexity of the service. However, the definition of
"team" may itself be fuzzy, as teams may be organized into higher-level divisions or subdivided
into smaller teams.</p><p>By contrast, if each team deploys dedicated workloads for each new client, they are using a
multi-customer model of tenancy. In this case, a "tenant" is simply a group of users who share a
single workload. This may be as large as an entire company, or as small as a single team at that
company.</p><p>In many cases, the same organization may use both definitions of "tenants" in different contexts.
For example, a platform team may offer shared services such as security tools and databases to
multiple internal “customers” and a SaaS vendor may also have multiple teams sharing a development
cluster. Finally, hybrid architectures are also possible, such as a SaaS provider using a
combination of per-customer workloads for sensitive data, combined with multi-tenant shared
services.</p><figure class="diagram-large"><img src="/images/docs/multi-tenancy.png"/><figcaption><h4>A cluster showing coexisting tenancy models</h4></figcaption></figure><h3 id="isolation">Isolation</h3><p>There are several ways to design and build multi-tenant solutions with Kubernetes. Each of these
methods comes with its own set of tradeoffs that impact the isolation level, implementation
effort, operational complexity, and cost of service.</p><p>A Kubernetes cluster consists of a control plane which runs Kubernetes software, and a data plane
consisting of worker nodes where tenant workloads are executed as pods. Tenant isolation can be
applied in both the control plane and the data plane based on organizational requirements.</p><p>The level of isolation offered is sometimes described using terms like “hard” multi-tenancy, which
implies strong isolation, and “soft” multi-tenancy, which implies weaker isolation. In particular,
"hard" multi-tenancy is often used to describe cases where the tenants do not trust each other,
often from security and resource sharing perspectives (e.g. guarding against attacks such as data
exfiltration or DoS). Since data planes typically have much larger attack surfaces, "hard"
multi-tenancy often requires extra attention to isolating the data-plane, though control plane
isolation also remains critical.</p><p>However, the terms "hard" and "soft" can often be confusing, as there is no single definition that
will apply to all users. Rather, "hardness" or "softness" is better understood as a broad
spectrum, with many different techniques that can be used to maintain different types of isolation
in your clusters, based on your requirements.</p><p>In more extreme cases, it may be easier or necessary to forgo any cluster-level sharing at all and
assign each tenant their dedicated cluster, possibly even running on dedicated hardware if VMs are
not considered an adequate security boundary. This may be easier with managed Kubernetes clusters,
where the overhead of creating and operating clusters is at least somewhat taken on by a cloud
provider. The benefit of stronger tenant isolation must be evaluated against the cost and
complexity of managing multiple clusters. The <a href="https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-multicluster/README.md">Multi-cluster SIG</a>
is responsible for addressing these types of use cases.</p><p>The remainder of this page focuses on isolation techniques used for shared Kubernetes clusters.
However, even if you are considering dedicated clusters, it may be valuable to review these
recommendations, as it will give you the flexibility to shift to shared clusters in the future if
your needs or capabilities change.</p><h2 id="control-plane-isolation">Control plane isolation</h2><p>Control plane isolation ensures that different tenants cannot access or affect each others'
Kubernetes API resources.</p><h3 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h3><p>In Kubernetes, a <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="An abstraction used by Kubernetes to support isolation of groups of resources within a single cluster." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces" target="_blank" aria-label="Namespace">Namespace</a> provides a
mechanism for isolating groups of API resources within a single cluster. This isolation has two
key dimensions:</p><ol><li><p>Object names within a namespace can overlap with names in other namespaces, similar to files in
folders. This allows tenants to name their resources without having to consider what other
tenants are doing.</p></li><li><p>Many Kubernetes security policies are scoped to namespaces. For example, RBAC Roles and Network
Policies are namespace-scoped resources. Using RBAC, Users and Service Accounts can be
restricted to a namespace.</p></li></ol><p>In a multi-tenant environment, a Namespace helps segment a tenant's workload into a logical and
distinct management unit. In fact, a common practice is to isolate every workload in its own
namespace, even if multiple workloads are operated by the same tenant. This ensures that each
workload has its own identity and can be configured with an appropriate security policy.</p><p>The namespace isolation model requires configuration of several other Kubernetes resources,
networking plugins, and adherence to security best practices to properly isolate tenant workloads.
These considerations are discussed below.</p><h3 id="access-controls">Access controls</h3><p>The most important type of isolation for the control plane is authorization. If teams or their
workloads can access or modify each others' API resources, they can change or disable all other
types of policies thereby negating any protection those policies may offer. As a result, it is
critical to ensure that each tenant has the appropriate access to only the namespaces they need,
and no more. This is known as the "Principle of Least Privilege."</p><p>Role-based access control (RBAC) is commonly used to enforce authorization in the Kubernetes
control plane, for both users and workloads (service accounts).
<a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-and-clusterrole">Roles</a> and
<a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#rolebinding-and-clusterrolebinding">RoleBindings</a> are
Kubernetes objects that are used at a namespace level to enforce access control in your
application; similar objects exist for authorizing access to cluster-level objects, though these
are less useful for multi-tenant clusters.</p><p>In a multi-team environment, RBAC must be used to restrict tenants' access to the appropriate
namespaces, and ensure that cluster-wide resources can only be accessed or modified by privileged
users such as cluster administrators.</p><p>If a policy ends up granting a user more permissions than they need, this is likely a signal that
the namespace containing the affected resources should be refactored into finer-grained
namespaces. Namespace management tools may simplify the management of these finer-grained
namespaces by applying common RBAC policies to different namespaces, while still allowing
fine-grained policies where necessary.</p><h3 id="quotas">Quotas</h3><p>Kubernetes workloads consume node resources, like CPU and memory. In a multi-tenant environment,
you can use <a href="/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/">Resource Quotas</a> to manage resource usage of
tenant workloads. For the multiple teams use case, where tenants have access to the Kubernetes
API, you can use resource quotas to limit the number of API resources (for example: the number of
Pods, or the number of ConfigMaps) that a tenant can create. Limits on object count ensure
fairness and aim to avoid <em>noisy neighbor</em> issues from affecting other tenants that share a
control plane.</p><p>Resource quotas are namespaced objects. By mapping tenants to namespaces, cluster admins can use
quotas to ensure that a tenant cannot monopolize a cluster's resources or overwhelm its control
plane. Namespace management tools simplify the administration of quotas. In addition, while
Kubernetes quotas only apply within a single namespace, some namespace management tools allow
groups of namespaces to share quotas, giving administrators far more flexibility with less effort
than built-in quotas.</p><p>Quotas prevent a single tenant from consuming greater than their allocated share of resources
hence minimizing the “noisy neighbor” issue, where one tenant negatively impacts the performance
of other tenants' workloads.</p><p>When you apply a quota to namespace, Kubernetes requires you to also specify resource requests and
limits for each container. Limits are the upper bound for the amount of resources that a container
can consume. Containers that attempt to consume resources that exceed the configured limits will
either be throttled or killed, based on the resource type. When resource requests are set lower
than limits, each container is guaranteed the requested amount but there may still be some
potential for impact across workloads.</p><p>Quotas cannot protect against all kinds of resource sharing, such as network traffic.
Node isolation (described below) may be a better solution for this problem.</p><h2 id="data-plane-isolation">Data Plane Isolation</h2><p>Data plane isolation ensures that pods and workloads for different tenants are sufficiently
isolated.</p><h3 id="network-isolation">Network isolation</h3><p>By default, all pods in a Kubernetes cluster are allowed to communicate with each other, and all
network traffic is unencrypted. This can lead to security vulnerabilities where traffic is
accidentally or maliciously sent to an unintended destination, or is intercepted by a workload on
a compromised node.</p><p>Pod-to-pod communication can be controlled using <a href="/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/">Network Policies</a>,
which restrict communication between pods using namespace labels or IP address ranges.
In a multi-tenant environment where strict network isolation between tenants is required, starting
with a default policy that denies communication between pods is recommended with another rule that
allows all pods to query the DNS server for name resolution. With such a default policy in place,
you can begin adding more permissive rules that allow for communication within a namespace.
It is also recommended not to use empty label selector '{}' for namespaceSelector field in network policy definition,
in case traffic need to be allowed between namespaces.
This scheme can be further refined as required. Note that this only applies to pods within a single
control plane; pods that belong to different virtual control planes cannot talk to each other via
Kubernetes networking.</p><p>Namespace management tools may simplify the creation of default or common network policies.
In addition, some of these tools allow you to enforce a consistent set of namespace labels across
your cluster, ensuring that they are a trusted basis for your policies.</p><div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">Warning:</h4>Network policies require a <a href="/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/#cni">CNI plugin</a>
that supports the implementation of network policies. Otherwise, NetworkPolicy resources will be ignored.</div><p>More advanced network isolation may be provided by service meshes, which provide OSI Layer 7
policies based on workload identity, in addition to namespaces. These higher-level policies can
make it easier to manage namespace-based multi-tenancy, especially when multiple namespaces are
dedicated to a single tenant. They frequently also offer encryption using mutual TLS, protecting
your data even in the presence of a compromised node, and work across dedicated or virtual clusters.
However, they can be significantly more complex to manage and may not be appropriate for all users.</p><h3 id="storage-isolation">Storage isolation</h3><p>Kubernetes offers several types of volumes that can be used as persistent storage for workloads.
For security and data-isolation, <a href="/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/">dynamic volume provisioning</a>
is recommended and volume types that use node resources should be avoided.</p><p><a href="/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/">StorageClasses</a> allow you to describe custom "classes"
of storage offered by your cluster, based on quality-of-service levels, backup policies, or custom
policies determined by the cluster administrators.</p><p>Pods can request storage using a <a href="/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/">PersistentVolumeClaim</a>.
A PersistentVolumeClaim is a namespaced resource, which enables isolating portions of the storage
system and dedicating it to tenants within the shared Kubernetes cluster.
However, it is important to note that a PersistentVolume is a cluster-wide resource and has a
lifecycle independent of workloads and namespaces.</p><p>For example, you can configure a separate StorageClass for each tenant and use this to strengthen isolation.
If a StorageClass is shared, you should set a <a href="/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#reclaim-policy">reclaim policy of <code>Delete</code></a>
to ensure that a PersistentVolume cannot be reused across different namespaces.</p><h3 id="sandboxing-containers">Sandboxing containers</h3><p>Kubernetes pods are composed of one or more containers that execute on worker nodes.
Containers utilize OS-level virtualization and hence offer a weaker isolation boundary than
virtual machines that utilize hardware-based virtualization.</p><p>In a shared environment, unpatched vulnerabilities in the application and system layers can be
exploited by attackers for container breakouts and remote code execution that allow access to host
resources. In some applications, like a Content Management System (CMS), customers may be allowed
the ability to upload and execute untrusted scripts or code. In either case, mechanisms to further
isolate and protect workloads using strong isolation are desirable.</p><p>Sandboxing provides a way to isolate workloads running in a shared cluster. It typically involves
running each pod in a separate execution environment such as a virtual machine or a userspace
kernel. Sandboxing is often recommended when you are running untrusted code, where workloads are
assumed to be malicious. Part of the reason this type of isolation is necessary is because
containers are processes running on a shared kernel; they mount file systems like <code>/sys</code> and <code>/proc</code>
from the underlying host, making them less secure than an application that runs on a virtual
machine which has its own kernel. While controls such as seccomp, AppArmor, and SELinux can be
used to strengthen the security of containers, it is hard to apply a universal set of rules to all
workloads running in a shared cluster. Running workloads in a sandbox environment helps to
insulate the host from container escapes, where an attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain
access to the host system and all the processes/files running on that host.</p><p>Virtual machines and userspace kernels are two popular approaches to sandboxing.</p><h3 id="node-isolation">Node Isolation</h3><p>Node isolation is another technique that you can use to isolate tenant workloads from each other.
With node isolation, a set of nodes is dedicated to running pods from a particular tenant and
co-mingling of tenant pods is prohibited. This configuration reduces the noisy tenant issue, as
all pods running on a node will belong to a single tenant. The risk of information disclosure is
slightly lower with node isolation because an attacker that manages to escape from a container
will only have access to the containers and volumes mounted to that node.</p><p>Although workloads from different tenants are running on different nodes, it is important to be
aware that the kubelet and (unless using virtual control planes) the API service are still shared
services. A skilled attacker could use the permissions assigned to the kubelet or other pods
running on the node to move laterally within the cluster and gain access to tenant workloads
running on other nodes. If this is a major concern, consider implementing compensating controls
such as seccomp, AppArmor or SELinux or explore using sandboxed containers or creating separate
clusters for each tenant.</p><p>Node isolation is a little easier to reason about from a billing standpoint than sandboxing
containers since you can charge back per node rather than per pod. It also has fewer compatibility
and performance issues and may be easier to implement than sandboxing containers.
For example, nodes for each tenant can be configured with taints so that only pods with the
corresponding toleration can run on them. A mutating webhook could then be used to automatically
add tolerations and node affinities to pods deployed into tenant namespaces so that they run on a
specific set of nodes designated for that tenant.</p><p>Node isolation can be implemented using <a href="/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/">pod node selectors</a>.</p><h2 id="additional-considerations">Additional Considerations</h2><p>This section discusses other Kubernetes constructs and patterns that are relevant for multi-tenancy.</p><h3 id="api-priority-and-fairness">API Priority and Fairness</h3><p><a href="/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/">API priority and fairness</a> is a Kubernetes
feature that allows you to assign a priority to certain pods running within the cluster.
When an application calls the Kubernetes API, the API server evaluates the priority assigned to pod.
Calls from pods with higher priority are fulfilled before those with a lower priority.
When contention is high, lower priority calls can be queued until the server is less busy or you
can reject the requests.</p><p>Using API priority and fairness will not be very common in SaaS environments unless you are
allowing customers to run applications that interface with the Kubernetes API, for example,
a controller.</p><h3 id="qos">Quality-of-Service (QoS)</h3><p>When you’re running a SaaS application, you may want the ability to offer different
Quality-of-Service (QoS) tiers of service to different tenants. For example, you may have freemium
service that comes with fewer performance guarantees and features and a for-fee service tier with
specific performance guarantees. Fortunately, there are several Kubernetes constructs that can
help you accomplish this within a shared cluster, including network QoS, storage classes, and pod
priority and preemption. The idea with each of these is to provide tenants with the quality of
service that they paid for. Let’s start by looking at networking QoS.</p><p>Typically, all pods on a node share a network interface. Without network QoS, some pods may
consume an unfair share of the available bandwidth at the expense of other pods.
The Kubernetes <a href="https://www.cni.dev/plugins/current/meta/bandwidth/">bandwidth plugin</a> creates an
<a href="/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#extended-resources">extended resource</a>
for networking that allows you to use Kubernetes resources constructs, i.e. requests/limits, to
apply rate limits to pods by using Linux tc queues.
Be aware that the plugin is considered experimental as per the
<a href="/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/#support-traffic-shaping">Network Plugins</a>
documentation and should be thoroughly tested before use in production environments.</p><p>For storage QoS, you will likely want to create different storage classes or profiles with
different performance characteristics. Each storage profile can be associated with a different
tier of service that is optimized for different workloads such IO, redundancy, or throughput.
Additional logic might be necessary to allow the tenant to associate the appropriate storage
profile with their workload.</p><p>Finally, there’s <a href="/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/">pod priority and preemption</a>
where you can assign priority values to pods. When scheduling pods, the scheduler will try
evicting pods with lower priority when there are insufficient resources to schedule pods that are
assigned a higher priority. If you have a use case where tenants have different service tiers in a
shared cluster e.g. free and paid, you may want to give higher priority to certain tiers using
this feature.</p><h3 id="dns">DNS</h3><p>Kubernetes clusters include a Domain Name System (DNS) service to provide translations from names
to IP addresses, for all Services and Pods. By default, the Kubernetes DNS service allows lookups
across all namespaces in the cluster.</p><p>In multi-tenant environments where tenants can access pods and other Kubernetes resources, or where
stronger isolation is required, it may be necessary to prevent pods from looking up services in other
Namespaces.
You can restrict cross-namespace DNS lookups by configuring security rules for the DNS service.
For example, CoreDNS (the default DNS service for Kubernetes) can leverage Kubernetes metadata
to restrict queries to Pods and Services within a namespace. For more information, read an
<a href="https://github.com/coredns/policy#kubernetes-metadata-multi-tenancy-policy">example</a> of
configuring this within the CoreDNS documentation.</p><p>When a <a href="#virtual-control-plane-per-tenant">Virtual Control Plane per tenant</a> model is used, a DNS
service must be configured per tenant or a multi-tenant DNS service must be used.
Here is an example of a <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-nested/blob/main/virtualcluster/doc/tenant-dns.md">customized version of CoreDNS</a>
that supports multiple tenants.</p><h3 id="operators">Operators</h3><p><a href="/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">Operators</a> are Kubernetes controllers that manage
applications. Operators can simplify the management of multiple instances of an application, like
a database service, which makes them a common building block in the multi-consumer (SaaS)
multi-tenancy use case.</p><p>Operators used in a multi-tenant environment should follow a stricter set of guidelines.
Specifically, the Operator should:</p><ul><li>Support creating resources within different tenant namespaces, rather than just in the namespace
in which the Operator is deployed.</li><li>Ensure that the Pods are configured with resource requests and limits, to ensure scheduling and fairness.</li><li>Support configuration of Pods for data-plane isolation techniques such as node isolation and
sandboxed containers.</li></ul><h2 id="implementations">Implementations</h2><p>There are two primary ways to share a Kubernetes cluster for multi-tenancy: using Namespaces
(that is, a Namespace per tenant) or by virtualizing the control plane (that is, virtual control
plane per tenant).</p><p>In both cases, data plane isolation, and management of additional considerations such as API
Priority and Fairness, is also recommended.</p><p>Namespace isolation is well-supported by Kubernetes, has a negligible resource cost, and provides
mechanisms to allow tenants to interact appropriately, such as by allowing service-to-service
communication. However, it can be difficult to configure, and doesn't apply to Kubernetes
resources that can't be namespaced, such as Custom Resource Definitions, Storage Classes, and Webhooks.</p><p>Control plane virtualization allows for isolation of non-namespaced resources at the cost of
somewhat higher resource usage and more difficult cross-tenant sharing. It is a good option when
namespace isolation is insufficient but dedicated clusters are undesirable, due to the high cost
of maintaining them (especially on-prem) or due to their higher overhead and lack of resource
sharing. However, even within a virtualized control plane, you will likely see benefits by using
namespaces as well.</p><p>The two options are discussed in more detail in the following sections.</p><h3 id="namespace-per-tenant">Namespace per tenant</h3><p>As previously mentioned, you should consider isolating each workload in its own namespace, even if
you are using dedicated clusters or virtualized control planes. This ensures that each workload
only has access to its own resources, such as ConfigMaps and Secrets, and allows you to tailor
dedicated security policies for each workload. In addition, it is a best practice to give each
namespace names that are unique across your entire fleet (that is, even if they are in separate
clusters), as this gives you the flexibility to switch between dedicated and shared clusters in
the future, or to use multi-cluster tooling such as service meshes.</p><p>Conversely, there are also advantages to assigning namespaces at the tenant level, not just the
workload level, since there are often policies that apply to all workloads owned by a single
tenant. However, this raises its own problems. Firstly, this makes it difficult or impossible to
customize policies to individual workloads, and secondly, it may be challenging to come up with a
single level of "tenancy" that should be given a namespace. For example, an organization may have
divisions, teams, and subteams - which should be assigned a namespace?</p><p>One possible approach is to organize your namespaces into hierarchies, and share certain policies and
resources between them. This could include managing namespace labels, namespace lifecycles,
delegated access, and shared resource quotas across related namespaces. These capabilities can
be useful in both multi-team and multi-customer scenarios.</p><h3 id="virtual-control-plane-per-tenant">Virtual control plane per tenant</h3><p>Another form of control-plane isolation is to use Kubernetes extensions to provide each tenant a
virtual control-plane that enables segmentation of cluster-wide API resources.
<a href="#data-plane-isolation">Data plane isolation</a> techniques can be used with this model to securely
manage worker nodes across tenants.</p><p>The virtual control plane based multi-tenancy model extends namespace-based multi-tenancy by
providing each tenant with dedicated control plane components, and hence complete control over
cluster-wide resources and add-on services. Worker nodes are shared across all tenants, and are
managed by a Kubernetes cluster that is normally inaccessible to tenants.
This cluster is often referred to as a <em>super-cluster</em> (or sometimes as a <em>host-cluster</em>).
Since a tenant’s control-plane is not directly associated with underlying compute resources it is
referred to as a <em>virtual control plane</em>.</p><p>A virtual control plane typically consists of the Kubernetes API server, the controller manager,
and the etcd data store. It interacts with the super cluster via a metadata synchronization
controller which coordinates changes across tenant control planes and the control plane of the
super-cluster.</p><p>By using per-tenant dedicated control planes, most of the isolation problems due to sharing one
API server among all tenants are solved. Examples include noisy neighbors in the control plane,
uncontrollable blast radius of policy misconfigurations, and conflicts between cluster scope
objects such as webhooks and CRDs. Hence, the virtual control plane model is particularly
suitable for cases where each tenant requires access to a Kubernetes API server and expects the
full cluster manageability.</p><p>The improved isolation comes at the cost of running and maintaining an individual virtual control
plane per tenant. In addition, per-tenant control planes do not solve isolation problems in the
data plane, such as node-level noisy neighbors or security threats. These must still be addressed
separately.</p></div>
