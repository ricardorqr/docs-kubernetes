group for emails about security and major API announcements.</p><h2 id="report-a-vulnerability">Report a Vulnerability</h2><p>We're extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to
the Kubernetes Open Source Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community volunteers.</p><p>To make a report, submit your vulnerability to the <a href="https://hackerone.com/kubernetes">Kubernetes bug bounty program</a>.
This allows triage and handling of the vulnerability with standardized response times.</p><p>You can also email the private <a href="mailto:security@kubernetes.io">security@kubernetes.io</a>
list with the security details and the details expected for
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yaml">all Kubernetes bug reports</a>.</p><p>You may encrypt your email to this list using the GPG keys of the
<a href="https://git.k8s.io/security/README.md#product-security-committee-psc">Security Response Committee members</a>.
Encryption using GPG is NOT required to make a disclosure.</p><h3 id="when-should-i-report-a-vulnerability">When Should I Report a Vulnerability?</h3><ul><li>You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Kubernetes</li><li>You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Kubernetes</li><li>You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Kubernetes depends on<ul><li>For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="when-should-i-not-report-a-vulnerability">When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?</h3><ul><li>You need help tuning Kubernetes components for security</li><li>You need help applying security related updates</li><li>Your issue is not security related</li></ul><h2 id="security-vulnerability-response">Security Vulnerability Response</h2><p>Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by Security Response Committee members within 3 working days.
This will set off the <a href="https://git.k8s.io/security/security-release-process.md#disclosures">Security Release Process</a>.</p><p>Any vulnerability information shared with Security Response Committee stays within Kubernetes project
and will not be disseminated to other projects unless it is necessary to get the issue fixed.</p><p>As the security issue moves from triage, to identified fix, to release planning we will keep the reporter updated.</p><h2 id="public-disclosure-timing">Public Disclosure Timing</h2><p>A public disclosure date is negotiated by the Kubernetes Security Response Committee and the bug submitter.
We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. It is reasonable
to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested,
or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known)
to a few weeks. For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date
to be on the order of 7 days. The Kubernetes Security Response Committee holds the final say when setting a disclosure date.</p></div>
