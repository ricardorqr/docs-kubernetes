	MyPlugin runtime.Object `json:"myPlugin"`
}

type PluginA struct {
	AOption string `json:"aOption"`

	MyPlugin runtime.RawExtension `json:"myPlugin"`

type PluginA struct {
	AOption string `json:"aOption"`

The next step is to copy (using pkg/conversion) into the internal struct. The runtime package's DefaultScheme has conversion functions installed which will unpack the JSON stored in RawExtension, turning it into the correct object type, and storing it in the Object.
