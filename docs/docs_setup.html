<div class="td-content"><p>This section lists the different ways to set up and run Kubernetes.
When you install Kubernetes, choose an installation type based on: ease of maintenance, security,
control, available resources, and expertise required to operate and manage a cluster.</p><p>You can <a href="/releases/download/">download Kubernetes</a> to deploy a Kubernetes cluster
on a local machine, into the cloud, or for your own datacenter.</p><p>Several <a href="/docs/concepts/overview/components/">Kubernetes components</a> such as <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="Control plane component that serves the Kubernetes API." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="/docs/concepts/architecture/#kube-apiserver" target="_blank" aria-label="kube-apiserver">kube-apiserver</a> or <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in the cluster." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/" target="_blank" aria-label="kube-proxy">kube-proxy</a> can also be
deployed as <a href="/releases/download/#container-images">container images</a> within the cluster.</p><p>It is <strong>recommended</strong> to run Kubernetes components as container images wherever
that is possible, and to have Kubernetes manage those components.
Components that run containers - notably, the kubelet - can't be included in this category.</p><p>If you don't want to manage a Kubernetes cluster yourself, you could pick a managed service, including
<a href="/docs/setup/production-environment/turnkey-solutions/">certified platforms</a>.
There are also other standardized and custom solutions across a wide range of cloud and
bare metal environments.</p><h2 id="learning-environment">Learning environment</h2><p>If you're learning Kubernetes, use the tools supported by the Kubernetes community,
or tools in the ecosystem to set up a Kubernetes cluster on a local machine.
See <a href="/docs/tasks/tools/">Install tools</a>.</p><h2 id="production-environment">Production environment</h2><p>When evaluating a solution for a
<a href="/docs/setup/production-environment/">production environment</a>, consider which aspects of
operating a Kubernetes cluster (or <em>abstractions</em>) you want to manage yourself and which you
prefer to hand off to a provider.</p><p>For a cluster you're managing yourself, the officially supported tool
for deploying Kubernetes is <a href="/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/">kubeadm</a>.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next</h2><ul><li><a href="/releases/download/">Download Kubernetes</a></li><li>Download and <a href="/docs/tasks/tools/">install tools</a> including <code>kubectl</code></li><li>Select a <a href="/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/">container runtime</a> for your new cluster</li><li>Learn about <a href="/docs/setup/best-practices/">best practices</a> for cluster setup</li></ul><p>Kubernetes is designed for its <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="The container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of containers." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-control-plane" target="_blank" aria-label="control plane">control plane</a> to
