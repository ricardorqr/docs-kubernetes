# Kubernetes Documentation PDF Generator

This Python tool automatically crawls the Kubernetes official documentation sidebar (`https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/`), extracts every page contained in `<div class="td-content">`, saves each as an individual HTML file, merges related files by alphabetical grouping, and finally converts each merged HTML file into a PDF using Playwright.

All generated PDFs can be imported into **NotebookLM / Gemini** for offline study, search, and summarization.
